in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. and the earth was waste and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light. and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness. and god called the light day and the darkness he called night. and there was evening and there was morning one day. and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters. and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so. and god called the firmament heaven. and there was evening and there was morning a second day. and god said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so. and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good.  and god said let the earth put forth grass herbs yielding seed [and] fruittrees bearing fruit after their kind wherein is the seed thereof upon the earth and it was so. and the earth brought forth grass herbs yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit wherein is the seed thereof after their kind and god saw that it was good. and there was evening and there was morning a third day. and god said let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so. and god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night [he made] the stars also. and god set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good. and there was evening and there was morning a fourth day.  and god said let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  and god created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moveth wherewith the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind and god saw that it was good. and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on the earth. and there was evening and there was morning a fifth day. and god said let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind and it was so. and god made the beasts of the earth after their kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind and god saw that it was good. and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  and god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them. and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  and god said behold i have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for food and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life [i have given] every green herb for food and it was so. and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good. and there was evening and there was morning the sixth day. and the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them. and on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.  and god blessed the seventh day and hallowed it because that in it he rested from all his work which god had created and made. these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that jehovah god made earth and heaven.  and no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for jehovah god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. and jehovah god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. and jehovah god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed. and out of the ground made jehovah god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became four heads.  the name of the first is pishon that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone. and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of cush. and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth in front of assyria. and the fourth river is the euphrates.  and jehovah god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it. and jehovah god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. and jehovah god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him. and out of the ground jehovah god formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them and whatsoever the man called every living creature that was the name thereof.  and the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field but for man there was not found a help meet for him. and jehovah god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which jehovah god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man. and the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which jehovah god had made. and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die.  and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as god knowing good and evil. and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and she gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat. and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. and they heard the voice of jehovah god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of jehovah god amongst the trees of the garden. and jehovah god called unto the man and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself. and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat  and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat. and jehovah god said unto the woman what is this thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat. and jehovah god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this cursed art thou above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed he shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception in pain thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee. and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field  in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return. and the man called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living. and jehovah god made for adam and for his wife coats of skins and clothed them. and jehovah god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever therefore jehovah god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden the cherubim and the flame of a sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. and the man knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man with [the help of] jehovah. and again she bare his brother abel. and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground. and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto jehovah.  and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. and jehovah had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect. and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell. and jehovah said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shall it not be lifted up and if thou doest not well sin coucheth at the door and unto thee shall be its desire but do thou rule over it. and cain told abel his brother. and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him. and jehovah said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brothers keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground. and now cursed art thou from the ground which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.  and cain said unto jehovah my punishment is greater than i can bear. behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth and it will come to pass that whosoever findeth me will slay me. and jehovah said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. and jehovah appointed a sign for cain lest any finding him should smite him. and cain went out from the presence of jehovah and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden. and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch. and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methushael and methushael begat lamech. and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah. and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle. and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.  and zillah she also bare tubal cain the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah. and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me and a young man for bruising me if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold. and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth. for [said she] god hath appointed me another seed instead of abel for cain slew him. and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enosh. then began men to call upon the name of jehovah. this is the book of the generations of adam. in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created. and adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begat [a son] in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth and the days of adam after he begat seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.  and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died. and seth lived a hundred and five years and begat enosh and seth lived after he begat enosh eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died. and enosh lived ninety years and begat kenan. and enosh lived after he begat kenan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of enosh were nine hundred and five years and he died. and kenan lived seventy years and begat mahalalel and kenan lived after he begat mahalalel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of kenan were nine hundred and ten years and he died. and mahalalel lived sixty and five years and begat jared and mahalalel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died. and jared lived a hundred sixty and two years and begat enoch  and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died. and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him. and methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters. and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died. and lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years and begat a son and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands [which cometh] because of the ground which jehovah hath cursed. and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died. and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth. and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the ground and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all that they chose. and jehovah said my spirit shall not strive with man for ever for that he also is flesh yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years. the nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same were the mighty men that were of old the men of renown. and jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. and it repented jehovah that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart.  and jehovah said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the ground both man and beast and creeping things and birds of the heavens for it repenteth me that i have made them. but noah found favor in the eyes of jehovah. these are the generations of noah. noah was a righteous man [and] perfect in his generations noah walked with god. and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth. and the earth was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence. and god saw the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth. make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. and this is how thou shalt make it the length of the ark three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits.  a light shalt thou make to the ark and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it. and i behold i do bring the flood of waters upon this earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven everything that is in the earth shall die. but i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee. and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female. of the birds after their kind and of the cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive. and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them. thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he. and jehovah said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation.  of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven the male and his female and of the beasts that are not clean two the male and his female of the birds also of the heavens seven and seven male and female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living thing that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the ground. and noah did according unto all that jehovah commanded him. and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood. of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of birds and of everything that creepeth upon the ground there went in two and two unto noah into the ark male and female as god commanded noah. and it came to pass after the seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.  in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened. and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark they and every beast after its kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind and every bird after its kind every bird of every sort. and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god commanded him and jehovah shut him in. and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lifted up above the earth. and the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters.  and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered. and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life of all that was on the dry land died. and every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and creeping things and birds of the heavens and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only was left and they that were with him in the ark. and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days. and god remembered noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained  and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat. and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen.  and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven and it went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth. and he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him to the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth and he put forth his hand and took her and brought her in unto him into the ark. and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark  and the dove came in to him at eventide and lo in her mouth an oliveleaf plucked off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove and she returned not again unto him any more. and it came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dried. and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dry.  and god spake unto noah saying go forth from the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee. bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth. and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him  every beast every creeping thing and every bird whatsoever moveth upon the earth after their families went forth out of the ark. and noah builded an altar unto jehovah and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird and offered burntofferings on the altar. and jehovah smelled the sweet savor and jehovah said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for that the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more everything living as i have done. while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease. and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.  and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens with all wherewith the ground teemeth and all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered. every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you as the green herb have i given you all. but flesh with the life thereof [which is] the blood thereof shall ye not eat.  and surely your blood [the blood] of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it. and at the hand of man even at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man. whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man. and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein. and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you the birds the cattle and every beast of the earth with you. of all that go out of the ark even every beast of the earth.  and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.  and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. and the sons of noah that went forth from the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan. these three were the sons of noah and of these was the whole earth overspread. and noah began to be a husbandman and planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken. and he was uncovered within his tent. and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without.  and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness. and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. and he said blessed be jehovah the god of shem and let canaan be his servant. god enlarge japheth and let him dwell in the tents of shem and let canaan be his servant. and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died. now these are the generations of the sons of noah [namely] of shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood. the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras. and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah. and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim.  of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations. and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and put and canaan. and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabteca and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan. and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth. he was a mighty hunter before jehovah wherefore it is said like nimrod a mighty hunter before jehovah. and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar. out of that land he went forth into assyria and builded nineveh and rehobothir and calah and resen between nineveh and calah the same is the great city. and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim and pathrusim and casluhim whence went forth the philistines and caphtorim. and canaan begat sidon his firstborn and heth and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgashite and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite  and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanite spread abroad. and the border of the canaanite was from sidon as thou goest toward gerar unto gaza as thou goest toward sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboiim unto lasha. these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their lands in their nations. and unto shem the father of all the children of eber the elder brother of japheth to him also were children born. the sons of shem elam and asshur and arpachshad and lud and aram. and the sons of aram uz and hul and gether and mash. and arpachshad begat shelah and shelah begat eber. and unto eber were born two sons the name of the one was peleg. for in his days was the earth divided. and his brothers name was joktan. and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah and hadoram and uzal and diklah and obal and abimael and sheba and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan.  and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest toward sephar the mountain of the east. these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations. these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. and it came to pass as they journeyed east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there. and they said one to another come let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar. and they said come let us build us a city and a tower whose top [may reach] unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. and jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded. and jehovah said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do and now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do.  come let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech. so jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off building the city. therefore was the name of it called babel because jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. these are the generations of shem. shem was a hundred years old and begat arpachshad two years after the flood. and shem lived after he begat arpachshad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters. and arpachshad lived five and thirty years and begat shelah. and arpachshad lived after he begat shelah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters. and shelah lived thirty years and begat eber and shelah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters. and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters. and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu  and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters. and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters. and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters. and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah and nahor lived after he begat terah a hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters. and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran. now these are the generations of terah. terah begat abram nahor and haran. and haran begat lot. and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees. and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah. and sarai was barren she had no child.  and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughterinlaw his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there. and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran. now jehovah said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto the land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make they name great and be thou a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and him that curseth thee will i curse and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. so abram went as jehovah had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran. and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came.  and abram passed through the land unto the place of shechem unto the oak of moreh. and the canaanite was then in the land. and jehovah appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto jehovah who appeared unto him. and he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of beth el and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and ai on the east and there he builded an altar unto jehovah and called upon the name of jehovah. and abram journeyed going on still toward the south. and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was sore in the land. and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon and it will come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they will say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive. say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and that my soul may live because of thee.  and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. and the princes of pharaoh saw her and praised her to pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house. and he dealt well with abram for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and men servants and maidservants and sheasses and camels. and jehovah plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife. and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife why saidst thou she is my sister so that i took her to be my wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way. and pharaoh gave men charge concerning him and they brought him on the way and his wife and all that he had. and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south. and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold. and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and ai  unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of jehovah. and lot also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents. and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together. and there was a strife between the herdsmen of abrams cattle and the herdsmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then in the land. and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen for we are brethren. is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me. if [thou wilt take] the left hand then i will go to the right. or if [thou take] the right hand then i will go to the left. and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered every where before jehovah destroyed sodom and gomorrah like the garden of jehovah like the land of egypt as thou goest unto zoar.  so lot chose him all the plain of the jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other. abram dwelt in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom. now the men of sodom were wicked and sinners against jehovah exceedingly. and jehovah said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever. and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then may thy seed also be numbered. arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for unto thee will i give it. and abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of mamre which are in hebron and built there an altar unto jehovah. and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim  that they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar. all these joined together in the vale of siddim the same is the salt sea. twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness. and they returned and came to en mishpat the same is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazazontamar. and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of siddim  against chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five. now the vale of siddim was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and they fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain. and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way. and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed. and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew now he dwelt by the oaks of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram. and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he led forth his trained men born in his house three hundred and eighteen and pursued as far as dan. and he divided himself against them by night he and his servants and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus.  and he brought back all the goods and also brought back his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people. and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him at the vale of shaveh the same is the kings vale. and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was priest of god most high. and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of god most high possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be god most high who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. and he gave him a tenth of all. and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself. and abram said to the king of sodom i have lifted up my hand unto jehovah god most high possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet nor aught that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men that went with me aner eshcol and mamre. let them take their portion.  after these things the word of jehovah came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield [and] thy exceeding great reward. and abram said o lord jehovah what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and he that shall be possessor of my house is eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir. and behold the word of jehovah came unto him saying this man shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and number the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be. and he believed in jehovah and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.  and he said unto him i am jehovah that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it. and he said o lord jehovah whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heifer three years old and a she goat three years old and a ram three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon.  and he took him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each half over against the other but the birds divided he not. and the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses and abram drove them away. and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo a horror of great darkness fell upon him. and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance. but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age. and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full.  and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. in that day jehovah made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates  the kenite and the kenizzite and the kadmonite and the hittite and the perizzite and the rephaim and the amorite and the canaanite and the girgashite and the jebusite. now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar. and sarai said unto abram behold now jehovah hath restrained me from bearing go in i pray thee unto my handmaid it may be that i shall obtain children by her. and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai. and sarai abrams wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife. and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes.  and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i gave my handmaid into they bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes jehovah judge between me and thee.  but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her that which is good in thine eyes. and sarai dealt hardly with her and she fled from her face. and the angel of jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur. and he said hagar sarais handmaid whence camest thou and whither goest thou and she said i am fleeing from the face of my mistress sarai. and the angel of jehovah said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands. and the angel of jehovah said unto her i will greatly multiply thy seed that it shall not be numbered for multitude. and the angel of jehovah said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and thou shalt call his name ishmael because jehovah hath heard thy affliction. and he shall be [as] a wild ass among men his hand [shall be] against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell over against all his brethren. and she called the name of jehovah that spake unto her thou art a god that seeth for she said have i even here looked after him that seeth me  wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered. and hagar bare abram a son and abram called the name of his son whom hagar bare ishmael. and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram. and when abram was ninety years old and nine jehovah appeared to abram and said unto him i am god almighty walk before me and be thou perfect. and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly. and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations. neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for the father of a multitude of nations have i made thee. and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee. and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee.  and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land of thy sojournings all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god. and god said unto abraham and as for thee thou shalt keep my covenant thou and thy seed after thee throughout their generations. this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every male among you shall be circumcised. and ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you. and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every male throughout your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed. he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. and the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant.  and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be. and i will bless her and moreover i will give thee a son of her yea i will bless her and she shall be [a mother of] nations kings of peoples shall be of her. then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear and abraham said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee and god said nay but sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation. but my covenant will i establish with isaac whom sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham.  and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him. and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son. and all the men of his house those born in the house and those bought with money of a foreigner were circumcised with him. and jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood over against him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree  and i will fetch a morsel of bread and strengthen ye your heart after that ye shall pass on forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. and they said so do as thou hast said. and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes. and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the servant and he hasted to dress it. and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat. and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent. and he said i will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son. and sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him. now abraham and sarah were old [and] well stricken in age it had ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women. and sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also  and jehovah said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child who am old is anything too hard for jehovah at the set time i will return unto thee when the season cometh round and sarah shall have a son. then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid. and he said nay but thou didst laugh. and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way. and jehovah said shall i hide from abraham that which i do seeing that abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of jehovah to do righteousness and justice to the end that jehovah may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him. and jehovah said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous  i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know. and the men turned from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before jehovah. and abraham drew near and said wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked that so the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and jehovah said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sake. and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord who am but dust and ashes peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said i will not destroy it if i find there forty and five.  and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there. and he said i will not do it for the fortys sake. and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there. and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there. and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there. and he said i will not destroy it for the twentys sake. and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there. and he said i will not destroy it for the tens sake. and jehovah went his way as soon as he had left off communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place. and the two angels came to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot saw them and rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face to the earth and he said behold now my lords turn aside i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your way. and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night.  and he urged them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat. but before they lay down the men of the city [even] the men of sodom compassed the house round both young and old all the people from every quarter and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men that came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them. and lot went out unto them to the door and shut the door after him. and he said i pray you my brethren do not so wickedly. behold now i have two daughters that have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof. and they said stand back. and they said this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them. and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and drew near to break the door.  but the men put forth their hand and brought lot into the house to them and shut to the door. and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door. and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides sonin law and thy sons and thy daughters and whomsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of the place for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed great before jehovah and jehovah hath sent us to destroy it. and lot went out and spake unto his sonsinlaw who married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for jehovah will destroy the city. but he seemed unto his sonsin law as one that mocked. and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters that are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. but he lingered and the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters jehovah being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city.  and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed. and lot said unto them oh not so my lord behold now thy servant hath found favor in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest evil overtake me and i die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one. oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live. and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither. therefore the name of the city was called zoar. the sun was risen upon the earth when lot came unto zoar. then jehovah rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from jehovah out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground.  but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt. and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before jehovah and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt. and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters. and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father. and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose.  and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father. and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose. thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father. and the firstborn bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day. and the younger she also bare a son and called his name ben ammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day. and abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the south and dwelt between kadesh and shur. and he sojourned in gerar. and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister. and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah. but god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man because of the woman whom thou hast taken. for she is a mans wife.  now abimelech had not come near her. and he said lord wilt thou slay even a righteous nation said he not himself unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother. in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have i done this. and god said unto him in the dream yea i know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this and i also withheld thee from sinning against me. therefore suffered i thee not to touch her. now therefore restore the mans wife. for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live. and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine. and abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ear. and the men were sore afraid. then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and wherein have i sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing  and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place. and they will slay me for my wifes sake. and moreover she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother. and abimelech took sheep and oxen and men servants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife. and abimelech said behold my land is before thee. dwell where it pleaseth thee. and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. behold it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. and in respect of all thou art righted. and abraham prayed unto god. and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants. and they bare children. for jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife.  and jehovah visited sarah as he had said and jehovah did unto sarah as he had spoken. and sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him. and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac. and abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him. and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him. and sarah said god hath made me to laugh. every one that heareth will laugh with me. and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should give children suck for i have borne him a son in his old age. and the child grew and was weaned. and abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned. and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne unto abraham mocking. wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this handmaid and her son. for the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son even with isaac.  and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight on account of his son. and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid. in all that sarah saith unto thee hearken unto her voice. for in isaac shall thy seed be called. and also of the son of the handmaid will i make a nation because he is thy seed. and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and [gave her] the child and sent her away. and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba. and the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bowshot. for she said let me not look upon the death of the child. and she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept. and god heard the voice of the lad. and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not. for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.  arise lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand. for i will make him a great nation. and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink. and god was with the lad and he grew. and he dwelt in the wilderness and became as he grew up an archer. and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran. and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt. and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest. now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son. but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. and abraham said i will swear. and abraham reproved abimelech because of the well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away. and abimelech said i know not who hath done this thing. neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but today.  and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech. and they two made a covenant.  and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves and he said these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that it may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well. wherefore he called that place beersheba. because there they sware both of them. so they made a covenant at beersheba. and abimelech rose up and phicol the captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines. and [abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and called there on the name of jehovah the everlasting god. and abraham sojourned in the land of the philistines many days. and it came to pass after these things that god did prove abraham and said unto him abraham. and he said here am i. and he said take now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest even isaac and get thee into the land of moriah. and offer him there for a burntoffering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of.  and abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son. and he clave the wood for the burntoffering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him.  on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and we will worship and come again to you. and abraham took the wood of the burntoffering and laid it upon isaac his son. and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. and they went both of them together. and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father. and he said here am i my son. and he said behold the fire and the wood. but where is the lamb for a burntoffering and abraham said god will provide himself the lamb for a burntoffering my son. so they went both of them together. and they came to the place which god had told him of. and abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood. and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son.  and the angel of jehovah called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham. and he said here i am. and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him. for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me. and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh. as it is said to this day in the mount of jehovah it shall be provided. and the angel of jehovah called unto abraham a second time out of heaven and said by myself have i sworn saith jehovah because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore. and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. because thou hast obeyed my voice.  so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba. and abraham dwelt at beersheba. and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she also hath borne children unto they brother nahor. uz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram. and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel. and bethuel begat rebekah. these eight did milcah bear to nahor abrahams brother. and his concubine whose name was reumah she also bare tebah and gaham and tahash and maacah. and the life of sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. these were the years of the life of sarah. and sarah died in kiriatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan. and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her. and abraham rose up from before his dead and spake unto the children of heth saying i am a stranger and a sojourner with you. give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight. and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him  hear us my lord. thou art a prince of god among us. in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead. and abraham rose up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth. and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field. for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a buryingplace. now ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of heth. and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying nay my lord hear me. the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee. in the presence of the children of my people give i it thee. bury thy dead. and abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.  and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt i pray thee hear me. i will give the price of the field. take it of me and i will bury my dead there. and ephron answered abraham saying unto him my lord hearken unto me. a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead. and abraham hearkened unto ephron. and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver current [money] with the merchant. so the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the border thereof round about were made sure unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city. and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan.  and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the children of heth. and abraham was old [and] well stricken in age. and jehovah had blessed abraham in all things. and abraham said unto his servant the elder of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh. and i will make thee swear by jehovah the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell. but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son isaac. and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  jehovah the god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my nativity and who spake unto me and who sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land. he will send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence. and if the woman be not willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. only thou shalt not bring my son thither again. and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning this matter. and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed having all goodly things of his masters in his hand. and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor. and he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water. and he said o jehovah the god of my master abraham send me i pray thee good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham. behold i am standing by the fountain of water. and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.  and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink. and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also. let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac. and thereby shall i know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master. and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder. and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her. and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and came up. and the servant ran to meet her and said give me to drink i pray thee a little water from thy pitcher. and she said drink my lord. and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink. and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw for thy camels also until they have done drinking. and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw and drew for all his camels.  and the man looked stedfastly on her holding his peace to know whether jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not. and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee. is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bare unto nahor. she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in. and the man bowed his head and worshipped jehovah. and he said blessed be jehovah the god of my master abraham who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. as for me jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my masters brethren. and the damsel ran and told her mothers house according to these words. and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the fountain.  and it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me. that he came unto the man. and behold he was standing by the camels at the fountain. and he said come in thou blessed of jehovah. wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels. and the man came into the house and he ungirded the camels. and he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him. and there was set food before him to eat. but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand. and he said speak on. and he said i am abrahams servant. and jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. and he is become great. and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men servants and maidservants and camels and asses. and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old. and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell. but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife for my son. and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me. and he said unto me jehovah before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way. and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house. then shalt thou be clear from my oath when thou comest to my kindred. and if they give her not to thee thou shalt be clear from my oath. and i came this day unto the fountain and said o jehovah the god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go. behold i am standing by the fountain of water. and let it come to pass that the maiden that cometh forth to draw to whom i shall say give me i pray thee a little water from thy pitcher to drink. and she shall say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels. let the same be the woman whom jehovah hath appointed for my masters son.  and before i had done speaking in my heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. and she went down unto the fountain and drew. and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee. and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also. so i drank and she made the camels drink also. and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him. and i put the ring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands. and i bowed my head and worshipped jehovah and blessed jehovah the god of my master abraham who had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter for his son. and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me. and if not tell me. that i may turn to the right hand or to the left. then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from jehovah. we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as jehovah hath spoken.  and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he bowed himself down to the earth unto jehovah. and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah. he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night. and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master. and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us [a few] days at the least ten. after that she shall go. and he said unto them hinder me not seeing jehovah hath prospered my way. send me away that i may go to my master. and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth. and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go. and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men. and they blessed rebekah and said unto her our sister be thou [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.  and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man. and the servant took rebekah and went his way. and isaac came from the way of beerlahairoi. for he dwelt in the land of the south. and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming. and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she alighted from the camel. and she said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master. and she took her veil and covered herself. and the servant told isaac all the things that he had done. and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife. and he loved her. and isaac was comforted after his mothers death. and abraham took another wife and her name was keturah. and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah. and jokshan begat sheba and dedan. and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim.  and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah. all these were the children of keturah. and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac. but unto the sons of the concubines that abraham had abraham gave gifts. and he sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country. and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived a hundred threescore and fifteen years. and abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full [of years] and was gathered to his people. and isaac and ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre. the field which abraham purchased of the children of heth. there was abraham buried and sarah his wife. and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son. and isaac dwelt by beerlahairoi. now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham.  and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam and mishma and dumah and massa hadad and tema jetur naphish and kedemah. these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments. twelve princes according to their nations. and these are the years of the life of ishmael a hundred and thirty and seven years. and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people. and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria. he abode over against all his brethren. and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son. abraham begat isaac. and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the syrian of paddanaram the sister of laban the syrian to be his wife. and isaac entreated jehovah for his wife because she was barren. and jehovah was entreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived.  and the children struggled together within her. and she said if it be so wherefore do i live and she went to inquire of jehovah. and jehovah said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. and the one people shall be stronger than the other people. and the elder shall serve the younger. and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb. and the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment. and they called his name esau. and after that came forth his brother and his hand had hold on esaus heel. and his name was called jacob. and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. and the boys grew. and esau was a skilful hunter a man of the field. and jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents. now isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison. and rebekah loved jacob. and jacob boiled pottage. and esau came in from the field and he was faint. and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red [pottage]. for i am faint. therefore was his name called edom. and jacob said sell me first thy birthright.  and esau said behold i am about to die. and what profit shall the birthright do to me and jacob said swear to me first. and he sware unto him. and he sold his birthright unto jacob. and jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentils. and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. so esau despised his birthright. and there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the days of abraham. and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar. and jehovah appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt. dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of. sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee. for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father. and i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these lands. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws. and isaac dwelt in gerar.  and the men of the place asked him of his wife. and he said she is my sister. for he feared to say my wife. lest [said he] the men of the place should kill me for rebekah. because she was fair to look upon.  and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife. and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife. and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die because of her. and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. and abimelech charged all the people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. and isaac sowed in that land and found in the same year a hundredfold. and jehovah blessed him. and the man waxed great and grew more and more until he became very great. and he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great household. and the philistines envied him.  now all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped and filled with earth. and abimelech said unto isaac go from us. for thou art much mightier than we.  and isaac departed thence and encamped in the valley of gerar and dwelt there. and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father. for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham. and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water. and the herdsmen of gerar strove with isaacs herdsmen saying the water is ours. and he called the name of the well esek because they contended with him. and they digged another well and they strove for that also. and he called the name of it sitnah. and he removed from thence and digged another well. and for that they strove not. and he called the name of it rehoboth. and he said for now jehovah hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land. and he went up from thence to beersheba.  and jehovah appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father. fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake. and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of jehovah and pitched his tent there. and there isaacs servants digged a well. then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his host. and isaac said unto them wherefore are ye come unto me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you and they said we saw plainly that jehovah was with thee. and we said let there now be an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace. thou art now the blessed of jehovah. and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink. and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another. and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace.  and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water. and he called it shibah. therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day. and when esau was forty years old he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite. and they were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah. and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said unto him my son. and he said unto him here am i. and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death. now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me venison. and make me savory food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat. that my soul may bless thee before i die. and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son. and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it. and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying  bring me venison and make me savory food that i may eat and bless thee before jehovah before my death. now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee. go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. and i will make them savory food for thy father such as he loveth. and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat so that he may bless thee before his death. and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man. my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver. and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing. and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son. only obey my voice and go fetch me them. and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother. and his mother made savory food such as his father loved. and rebekah took the goodly garments of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son. and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck.  and she gave the savory food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob. and he came unto his father and said my father. and he said here am i. who art thou my son and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me. and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because jehovah thy god sent me good speed. and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not. and jacob went near unto isaac his father. and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau. and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands. so he blessed him. and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am. and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee. and he brought it near to him and he did eat. and he brought him wine and he drank.  and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son. and he came near and kissed him. and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which jehovah hath blessed. and god five thee of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and new wine. let peoples serve thee and nations bow down to thee. be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee. cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be every one that blesseth thee. and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting. and he also made savory food and brought it unto his father. and he said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me. and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy first born esau.  and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who then is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea [and] he shall be blessed. when esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father. and he said thy brother came with guile and hath taken away thy blessing. and he said is not he rightly name jacob for he hath supplanted me these two time. he took away my birthright. and behold now he hath taken away my blessing. and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants. and with grain and new wine have i sustained him. and what then shall i do for thee my son and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father. and esau lifted up his voice and wept.  and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling and of the dew of heaven from above. and by thy sword shalt thou live and thou shalt serve thy brother. and it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose that thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck. and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand. then will i slay my brother jacob. and the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah. and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself [purposing] to kill thee. now therefore my son obey my voice. and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran. and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away. until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him. then i will send and fetch thee from thence. why should i be bereaved of you both in one day  and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth. if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan. arise go to paddanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father. and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mothers brother. and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a company of peoples. and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee. that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings which god gave unto abraham. and isaac sent away jacob. and he went to paddanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother. now esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddan aram to take him a wife from thence. and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan.  and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to paddanaram. and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father. and esau went unto ishmael and took besides the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife. and jacob went out from beer sheba and went toward haran. and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set. and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. and he dreamed. and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven. and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it. and behold jehovah stood above it and said i am jehovah the god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac. the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed. and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  and behold i am with thee and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest and will bring thee again into this land. for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of. and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely jehovah is in this place. and i knew it not. and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven. and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. and he called the name of that place bethel. but the name of the city was luz at the first. and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my fathers house in peace and jehovah will be my god then this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be gods house. and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee. then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east.  and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo three flocks of sheep lying there by it. for out of that well they watered the flocks. and the stone upon the wells mouth was great. and thither were all the flocks gathered. and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in its place. and jacob said unto them my brethren whence are ye and they said of haran are we. and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him. and he said unto them is it well with him and they said it is well. and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. water ye the sheep and go and feed them. and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and they roll the stone from the wells mouth. then we water the sheep. while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep. for she kept them.  and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother. and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept. and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son. and she ran and told her father. and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. and he told laban all these things. and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh. and he abode with him the space of a month. and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be and laban had two daughters. the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel. and leahs eyes were tender. but rachel was beautiful and well favored.  and jacob loved rachel. and he said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter. and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man. abide with me. and jacob served seven years for rachel. and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her. and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her. and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast. and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him. and he went in unto her. and laban gave zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter leah for a handmaid. and it came to pass in the morning that behold it was leah. and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me and laban said it is not so done in our place to give the younger before the first born. fulfil the week of this one and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.  and jacob did so and fulfilled her week. and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife. and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years. and jehovah saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb. but rachel was barren. and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben. for she said because jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. for now my husband will love me. and she conceived again and bare a son and said because jehovah hath heard that i am hated he hath therefore given me this [son] also. and she called his name simeon. and she conceived again and bare a son. and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have borne him three sons. therefore was his name called levi. and she conceived again and bare a son. and she said this time will i praise jehovah. therefore she called his name judah. and she left off bearing.  and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and she said unto jacob give me children or else i die. and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her that she may bear upon my knees and i also may obtain children by her. and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her. and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son. and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan. and bilhah rachels handmaid conceived again and bare jacob a second son. and rachel said with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and have prevailed and she called his name naphtali. when leah saw that she had left off bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob to wife. and zilpah leahs handmaid bare jacob a son. and leah said fortunate and she called his name gad. and zilpah leahs handmaid bare jacob a second son.  and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me happy and she called his name asher.  and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah. then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes. and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy sons mandrakes. and jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for i have surely hired thee with my sons mandrakes. and he lay with her that night. and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob a fifth son. and leah said god hath given me my hire because i gave my handmaid to my husband and she called his name issachar. and leah conceived again and bare a sixth son to jacob. and leah said god hath endowed me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have borne him six sons and she called his name zebulun.  and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah. and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb.  and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach and she called his name joseph saying jehovah add to me another son. and it came to pass when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country. give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service wherewith i have served thee. and laban said unto him if now i have found favor in thine eyes [tarry] [for] i have divined that jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake. and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it. and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle have fared with me. for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it hath increased unto a multitude and jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever i turned and now when shall i provide for mine own house also  and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me aught if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed thy flock and keep it. i will pass through all thy flock today removing from thence every speckled and spotted one and every black one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and [of such] shall be my hire.  so shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep that [if found] with me shall be counted stolen. and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word. and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstreaked and spotted and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the black ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks.  and jacob took him rods of fresh poplar and of the almond and of the planetree. and peeled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods. and he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink and they conceived when they came to drink. and the flocks conceived before the rods and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked speckled and spotted. and jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of laban and he put his own droves apart and put them not unto labans flock. and it came to pass whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods but when the flock were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs. and the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks and maid servants and menservants and camels and asses.  and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory. and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as beforetime. and jehovah said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee. and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as beforetime but the god of my father hath been with me. and ye know that will all my power i have served your father. and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me. if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the flock bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstreaked shall be thy wages then bare all the flock ringstreaked. thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me.  and it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the he goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked speckled and grizzled. and the angel of god said unto me in the dream jacob and i said here am i. and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the hegoats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee. i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst a pillar where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy nativity. and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house are we not accounted by him as foreigners for he hath sold us and hath also quite devoured our money. for all the riches which god hath taken away from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do. then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels  and he carried away all his cattle and all his substance which he had gathered the cattle of his getting which he had gathered in paddanaram to go to isaac his father unto the land of canaan. now laban was gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim that were her fathers. and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled. so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of gilead. and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled. and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and he overtook him in the mountain of gilead. and god came to laban the syrian in a dream of the night and said unto him take heed to thyself that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad. and laban came up with jacob. now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of gilead. and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword  wherefore didst thou flee secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters now hast thou done foolishly. it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take heed to thyself that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad. and now [though] thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force. with whomsoever thou findest thy gods he shall not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee. for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them. and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the tent of the two maidservants but he found them not. and he went out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent.  now rachel had taken the teraphim and put them in the camels saddle and sat upon them. and laban felt about all the tent but found them not. and she said to her father let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before thee for the manner of women is upon me. and he searched but found not the teraphim. and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast hotly pursued after me whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us two. these twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flocks have i not eaten. that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night. thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from mine eyes.  these twenty years have i been in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock and thou hast changed my wages ten times. except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. god hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight. and laban answered and said unto jacob the daughters are my daughters and the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children whom they have borne and now come let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee. and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar. and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made a heap and they did eat there by the heap. and laban called it jegarsaha dutha but jacob called it galeed. and laban said this heap is witness between me and thee this day. therefore was the name of it called galeed  and mizpah for he said jehovah watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another. if thou shalt afflict my daughters and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee. and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold the pillar which i have set betwixt me and thee. this heap be witness and the pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm. the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us. and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac. and jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mountain. and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place. and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him. and jacob said when he saw them this is gods host and he called the name of that place mahanaim.  and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the field of edom. and he commanded them saying thus shall ye say unto my lord esau thus saith thy servant jacob i have sojourned with laban and stayed until now and i have oxen and asses [and] flocks and men servants and maidservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find favor in thy sight. and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and moreover he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him. then jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed and he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two companies and he said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the company which is left shall escape. and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac o jehovah who saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will do thee good  i am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two companies. deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and smite me the mother with the children. and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude. and he lodged there that night and took of that which he had with him a present for esau his brother two hundred she goats and twenty hegoats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milch camels and their colts forty cows and ten bulls twenty sheasses and ten foals. and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by itself and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove. and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee  then thou shalt say [they are] thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold he also is behind us. and he commanded also the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him and ye shall say moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us. for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept me. so the present passed over before him and he himself lodged that night in the company. and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two handmaids and his eleven children and passed over the ford of the jabbok. and he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over that which he had. and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was strained as he wrestled with him.  and he said let me go for the day breaketh. and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me. and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob. and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for thou hast striven with god and with men and hast prevailed. and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name. and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there. and jacob called the name of the place peniel for [said he] i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved. and the sun rose upon him as he passed over penuel and he limped upon his thigh. therefore the children of israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew of the hip. and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau was coming and with him four hundred men. and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids. and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost.  and he himself passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother. and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept. and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are these with thee and he said the children whom god hath graciously given thy servant. then the handmaids came near they and their children and they bowed themselves. and leah also and her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves. and he said what meanest thou by all this company which i met and he said to find favor in the sight of my lord. and esau said i have enough my brother let that which thou hast be thine. and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found favor in thy sight then receive my present at my hand forasmuch as i have seen thy face as one seeth the face of god and thou wast pleased with me.  take i pray thee my gift that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough. and he urged him and he took it. and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee. and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds with me have their young and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die. let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on gently according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come unto my lord unto seir. and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. and he said what needeth it let me find favor in the sight of my lord. so esau returned that day on his way unto seir. and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him a house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth. and jacob came in peace to the city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from paddan aram and encamped before the city.  and he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for a hundred pieces of money. and he erected there an altar and called it el eloheisrael. and dinah the daughter of leah whom she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land. and shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her and he took her and lay with her and humbled her. and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel. and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife. now jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter and his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they came. and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him. and the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done.  and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her unto him to wife. and make ye marriages with us give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you. and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein. and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find favor in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give. ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife. and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with guile and spake because he had defiled dinah their sister and said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us. only on this condition will we consent unto you if ye will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people.  but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone. and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son. and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was honored above all the house of his father. and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters.  only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us to become one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised. shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us. and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city.  and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city unawares and slew all the males. and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went forth. the sons of jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister. they took their flocks and their herds and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field  and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and made a prey even all that was in the house. and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they will gather themselves together against me and smite me and i shall be destroyed i and my house. and they said should he deal with our sister as with a harlot  and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother. then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went. and they gave unto jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand and the rings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem. and they journeyed and a terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob.  so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan the same is bethel he and all the people that were with him. and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god was revealed unto him when he fled from the face of his brother.  and deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried below bethel under the oak and the name of it was called allon bacuth. and god appeared unto jacob again when he came from paddan aram and blessed him. and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel. and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which i gave unto abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land. and god went up from him in the place where he spake with him. and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him a pillar of stone and he poured out a drink offering thereon and poured oil thereon. and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel. and they journeyed from bethel and there was still some distance to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labor.  and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not for now thou shalt have another son. and it came to pass as her soul was departing for she died that she called his name ben oni but his father called him benjamin. and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath the same is beth lehem. and jacob set up a pillar upon her grave the same is the pillar of rachels grave unto this day. and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder. and it came to pass while israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his fathers concubine and israel heard of it. now the sons of jacob were twelve the sons of leah reuben jacobs firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin and the sons of bilhah rachels handmaid dan and naphtali and the sons of zilpah leahs handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of jacob that were born to him in paddanaram. and jacob came unto isaac his father to mamre to kiriatharba the same is hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned.  and the days of isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people old and full of days and esau and jacob his sons buried him. now these are the generations of esau the same is edom. esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and oholibamah the daughter of anah the

of esau that were born unto him in the land of canaan. and esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the souls of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all his possessions which he had gather in the land of canaan and went into a land away from his brother jacob. for their substance was too great for them to dwell together and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle. and esau dwelt in mount seir esau is edom. and these are the generations of esau the father of the edomites in mount seir  these are the names of esaus sons eliphaz

these are the generations of jacob. joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and he was a lad with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father. now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors. and his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren and they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him. and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more.  and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came round about and made obeisance to my sheaf. and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words. and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said behold i have dreamed yet a dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me. and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth and his brethren envied him but his father kept the saying in mind. and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem. and israel said unto joseph are not thy brethren feeding the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them. and he said to him here am i.  and he said to him go now see whether it is well with thy brethren and well with the flock and bring me word again. so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem. and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou and he said i am seeking my brethren tell me i pray thee where they are feeding [the flock]. and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan. and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan. and they saw him afar off and before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him. and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh. come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say and evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams. and reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said let us not take his life. and reuben said unto them shed no blood cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand upon him that he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father.  and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into the pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it. and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a caravan of ishmaelites was coming from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt. and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come and let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother our flesh. and his brethren hearkened unto him. and there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. and they brought joseph into egypt. and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes. and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go  and they took josephs coat and killed a he goat and dipped the coat in the blood and they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it is thy sons coat or not. and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. and jacob rent his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days. and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down to sheol to my son mourning. and his father wept for him. and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard. and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah. and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua. and he took her and went in unto her. and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er.  and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan. and she yet again bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him. and judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar. and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of jehovah. and jehovah slew him. and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and perform the duty of a husbands brother unto her and raise up seed to thy brother. and onan knew that the seed would not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest he should give seed to his brother. and the thing which he did was evil in the sight of jehovah and he slew him also. then said judah to tamar his daughterinlaw remain a widow in thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown up for he said lest he also die like his brethren. and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house. and in process of time shuas daughter the wife of judah died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheep shearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite.  and it was told tamar saying behold thy fatherinlaw goeth up to timnah to shear his sheep. and she put off from her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she was not given unto him to wife. when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot for she had covered her face. and he turned unto her by the way and said come i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughterin law. and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy cord and thy staff that is in thy hand. and he gave them to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him. and she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood.  and judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the womans hand but he found her not. then he asked the men of her place saying where is the prostitute that was at enaim by the wayside and they said there hath been no prostitute here. and he returned to judah and said i have not found her and also the men of the place said there hath been no prostitute here. and judah said let her take it to her lest we be put to shame behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her. and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughterinlaw hath played the harlot and moreover behold she is with child by whoredom. and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt. when she was brought forth she sent to her father inlaw saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and the cords and the staff. and judah acknowledged them and said she is more righteous than i forasmuch as i gave her not to shelah my son. and he knew her again no more.  and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb. and it came to pass when she travailed that one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first. and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself therefore his name was called perez. and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zerah. and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hand of the ishmaelites that had brought him down thither. and jehovah was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian. and his master saw that jehovah was with him and that jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand. and joseph found favor in his sight and he ministered unto him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand.  and it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that jehovah blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not aught [that was] with him save the bread which he did eat. and joseph was comely and well favored. and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me. but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master knoweth not what is with me in the house and he hath put all that he hath into my hand he is not greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her [or] to be with her. and it came to pass about this time that he went into the house to do his work and there was none of the men of the house there within.  and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out. and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in a hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice  and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and fled and got him out. and she laid up his garment by her until his master came home. and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and fled out. and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled. and josephs master took him and put him into the prison the place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison.  but jehovah was with joseph and showed kindness unto him and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it. the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because jehovah was with him and that which he did jehovah made it prosper.  and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt. and pharaoh was wroth against his two officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers. and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound. and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he ministered unto them and they continued a season in ward. and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt who were bound in the prison.  and joseph came in unto them in the morning and saw them and behold they were sad. and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in ward in his masters house saying wherefore look ye so sad today and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it. and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell it me i pray you. and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me  and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded [and] its blossoms shot forth [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand. and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days within yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee unto thine office and thou shalt give pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler.  but have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days within yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.  and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them. yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him. and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river. and behold there came up out of the river seven kine well favored and fat fleshed and they fed in the reed grass. and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river illfavored and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. and the ill favored and lean fleshed kine did eat up the seven wellfavored and fat kine. so pharaoh awoke. and he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk rank and good. and behold seven ears thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. and the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.  and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh. then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. and there was with us there a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret. and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged. then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh.  and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it. and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god will give pharaoh an answer of peace. and pharaoh spake unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the brink of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fat fleshed and well favored and they fed in the reed grass and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very illfavored and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness and the lean and illfavored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favored as at the beginning. so i awoke. and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk full and good and behold seven ears withered thin [and] blasted with the east wind sprung up after them  and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears and i told it unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me. and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he hath declared unto pharaoh. the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one. and the seven lean and ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind they shall be seven years of famine. that is the thing which i spake unto pharaoh what god is about to do he hath showed unto pharaoh. behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth for it shall be very grievous. and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass.  now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt. let pharaoh do [this] and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years. and let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up grain under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it. and the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine. and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath showed thee all of this there is none so discreet and wise as thou thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou. and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt.  and pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he set him over all the land of egypt. and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt. and pharaoh called josephs name zaphenath paneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of poti phera priest of on. and joseph went out over the land of egypt. and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt. and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt. and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same. and joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea very much until he left off numbering for it was without number.  and unto joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bare unto him. and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for [said he] god hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house. and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. and the seven years of plenty that was in the land of egypt came to an end. and the seven years of famine began to come according as joseph had said and there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread. and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do. and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine was sore in the land of egypt. and all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain because the famine was sore in all the earth.  now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt and jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another and he said behold i have heard that there is grain in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die. and josephs ten brethren went down to buy grain from egypt. but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure harm befall him. and the sons of israel came to buy among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan. and joseph was the governor over the land he it was that sold to all the people of the land. and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly with them and he said unto them. whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food. and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him. and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.  and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come. we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies. and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. and they said we thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not. and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither. send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be bound that your words may be proved whether there be truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies. and he put them all together into ward three days. and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in your prisonhouse but go ye carry grain for the famine of your houses and bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die. and they did so.  and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us. and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore also behold his blood is required. and they knew not that joseph understood them for there was an interpreter between them. and he turned himself about from them and wept and he returned to them and spake to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes. then joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provisions for the way and thus was it done unto them. and they laded their asses with their grain and departed thence. and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodgingplace he espied his money and behold it was in the mouth of his sack.  and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying what is this that god hath done unto us and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that had befallen them saying the man the lord of the land spake roughly with us and took us for spies of the country. and we said unto him we are true men and we are no spies we are twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan. and the man the lord of the land said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren with me and take [grain for] the famine of your houses and go your way and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land. and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid.  and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me. and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again. and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm befall him by the way in which ye go then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol. and the famine was sore in the land. and it came to pass when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food. and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you. if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you. and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother  and they said the man asked straitly concerning ourselves and concerning our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye [another] brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we in any wise know that he would say bring your brother down and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones. i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever for except we had lingered surely we had now returned a second time. and their father israel said unto them if it be so now do this take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spicery and myrrh nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight take also your brother and arise go again unto the man  and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release unto you your other brother and benjamin. and if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved. and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph. and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house bring the men into the house and slay and make ready for the men shall dine with me at noon. and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men to josephs house. and the men were afraid because they were brought to josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses. and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they spake unto him at the door of the house and said oh my lord we came indeed down at the first time to buy food  and it came to pass when we came to the lodgingplace that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand. and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food we know not who put our money in our sacks. and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money. and he brought simeon out unto them. and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet. and he gave their asses provender. and they made ready the present against josephs coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there. and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down themselves to him to the earth. and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive and they said thy servant our father is well he is yet alive. and they bowed the head and made obeisance.  and he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and said is this your youngest brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son. and joseph made haste for his heart yearned over his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there. and he washed his face and came out and he refrained himself and said set on bread. and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians that did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians. and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one with another.  and he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him but benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs. and they drank and were merry with him. and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth.  and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his grain money. and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken. as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses. [and] when they were gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good is not this that in which my lord drinketh and whereby he indeed divineth ye have done evil in so doing. and he overtook them and he spake unto them these words. and they said unto him wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.  behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold with whomsoever of thy servants it be found let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen.  and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my bondman and ye shall be blameless. then they hasted and took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack. and he searched [and] began at the eldest and left off at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack. then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city. and judah and his brethren came to josephs house and he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground. and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done know ye not that such a man as i can indeed divine and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords bondmen both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found.  and he said far be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my bondman but as for you get you up in peace unto your father.  then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh. my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him. and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him. and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die. and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more. and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord. and our father said go again buy us a little food. and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face expect our youngest brother be with us. and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons  and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i have not seen him since and if ye take this one also from me and harm befall him ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol. now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad is not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life it will come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not [with us] that he will die and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to sheol. for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then shall i bear the blame to my father for ever. now therefore let thy servant i pray thee abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren. for how shall i go up to my father if the lad be not with me lest i see the evil that shall come on my father. then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him and he cried cause every man to go out from me. and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren. and he wept aloud and the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard.  and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence. and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you. and they came near. and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt. and now be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life. for these two years hath the famine been in the land and there are yet five years in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. and god sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth and to save you alive by a great deliverance. so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt. haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast  and there will i nourish thee for there are yet five years of famine lest thou come to poverty thou and thy household and all that thou hast. and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck. and he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him. and the report thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants. and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land. now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.  also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours. and the sons of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way. to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment. and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten sheasses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way. and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father. and they told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt. and his heart fainted for he believed them not. and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived  and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die. and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac. and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob. and he said here am i. and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. and jacob rose up from beer sheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him. and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sonss daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt. and these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn.  and the sons of reuben hanoch and pallu and hezron and carmi. and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman. and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari. and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and perez and zerah but er and onan died in the land of canaan. and the sons of perez were hezron and hamul. and the sons of issachar tola and puvah and iob and shimron. and the sons of zebulun sered and elon and jahleel. these are the sons of leah whom she bare unto jacob in paddanaram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. and the sons of gad ziphion and haggi shuni and ezbon eri and arodi and areli. and the sons of asher imnah and ishvah and ishvi and beriah and serah their sister and the sons of beriah heber and malchiel. these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his daughter and these she bare unto jacob even sixteen souls. the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin.  and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim whom asenath the daughter of poti phera priest of on bare unto him. and the sons of benjamin bela and becher and ashbel gera and naaman ehi and rosh muppim and huppim and ard. these are the sons of rachel who were born to jacob all the souls were fourteen. and the sons of dan hushim. and the sons of naphtali jahzeel and guni and jezer and shillem. these are the sons of bilhah whom laban gave unto rachel his daughter and these she bare unto jacob all the souls were seven. all the souls that came with jacob into egypt that came out of his loins besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore and six and the sons of joseph who were born to him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob that came into egypt were threescore and ten. and he sent judah before him unto joseph to show the way before him unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen.  and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and he presented himself unto him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while. and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face that thou art yet alive. and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and tell pharaoh and will say unto him my brethren and my fathers house who were in the land of canaan are come unto me and the men are shepherds for they have been keepers of cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have. and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation that ye shall say thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians. then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen.  and from among his brethren he took five men and presented them unto pharaoh. and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and our fathers. and they said unto pharaoh to sojourn in the land are we come for there is no pasture for thy servants flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen. and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any able men among them then make them rulers over my cattle. and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh. and pharaoh said unto jacob how many are the days of the years of thy life  and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh. and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded. and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to their families. and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine. and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the grain which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house.  and when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for [our] money faileth. and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail. and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. and when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide from my lord how that our money is all spent and the herds of cattle are my lords there is nought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands wherefore should we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land be not desolate. so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine was sore upon them and the land became pharaohs.  and as for the people he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof. only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their land. then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land. and it shall come to pass at the ingatherings that ye shall give a fifth unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones. and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find favor in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants. and joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth only the land of the priests alone became not pharaohs. and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they gat them possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.  and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were a hundred forty and seven years. and the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found favor in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt but when i sleep with my fathers thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their burying place. and he said i will do as thou hast said. and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him. and israel bowed himself upon the beds head. and it came to pass after these things that one said to joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim. and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed. and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me  and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a company of peoples and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. and now thy two sons who were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon shall be mine. and thy issue that thou begettest after them shall be thine they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. and as for me when i came from paddan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some distance to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way to ephrath the same is beth lehem. and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me here. and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them. now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see. and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them.  and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath let me see thy seed also. and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him. and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the first born. and he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god who hath fed me all my life long unto this day the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head.  and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the first born put thy right hand upon his head. and his father refused and said i know [it] my son i know [it]. he also shall become a people and he also shall be great howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. and he blessed them that day saying in thee will israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh. and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god will be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow. and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. assemble yourselves and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father. reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the preeminence of dignity and the preeminence of power.  boiling over as water thou shalt not have the pre eminence because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch. simeon and levi are brethren weapons of violence are their swords. o my soul come not thou into their council unto their assembly my glory be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they hocked an ox. cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel. judah thee shall thy brethren praise thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies thy fathers sons shall bow down before thee. judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be. binding his foal unto the vine and his asss colt unto the choice vine he hath washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk.  zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for a haven of ships and his border shall be upon sidon. issachar is a strong ass couching down between the sheepfolds and he saw a restingplace that it was good and the land that it was pleasant and he bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant under taskwork. dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel. dan shall be a serpent in the way an adder in the path that biteth the horses heels so that his rider falleth backward. i have waited for thy salvation o jehovah. gad a troop shall press upon him but he shall press upon their heel. out of the asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties. naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words. joseph is a fruitful bough a fruitful bough by a fountain his branches run over the wall. the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and persecute him but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty one of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel  even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath blessings of the breasts and of the womb.  the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. benjamin is a wolf that raveneth in the morning she shall devour the prey and at even he shall divide the spoil. all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them. and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field from ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.  there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah the field and the cave that is therein which was purchased from the children of heth.  and when jacob made an end of charging his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people. and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him. and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel. and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of embalming and the egyptians wept for him three score and ten days. and when the days of weeping for him were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found favor in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me. now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again.  and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear. and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen. and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company. and they came to the threshing floor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days. and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abel mizraim which is beyond the jordan. and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them  for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre. and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father. and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph will hate us and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him. and they sent a message unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the transgression of thy brethren and their sin for that they did unto thee evil. and now we pray thee forgive the transgression of the servants of the god of thy father. and joseph wept when they spake unto him. and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are thy servants. and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god  and as for you ye meant evil against me but god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones. and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them. and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived a hundred and ten years. and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born upon josephs knees. and joseph said unto his brethren i die but god will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob. and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. so joseph died being a hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt. now these are the names of the sons of israel who came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher.  and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls and joseph was in egypt already. and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation. and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them. now there arose a new king over egypt who knew not joseph. and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we come let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they also join themselves unto our enemies and fight against us and get them up out of the land. therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. and they built for pharaoh store cities pithom and raamses. but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. and they were grieved because of the children of israel. and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigor  and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve with rigor. and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of whom the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the birth stool if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live. but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the menchildren alive. and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them. and god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty. and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them households.  and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive. and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi. and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months. and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and she put the child therein and laid it in the flags by the rivers brink. and his sister stood afar off to know what would be done to him. and the daughter of pharaoh came down to bathe at the river and her maidens walked along by the riverside and she saw the ark among the flags and sent her handmaid to fetch it. and she opened it and saw the child and behold the babe wept. and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children. then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and pharaohs daughter said to her go. and the maiden went and called the childs mother.  and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages. and the woman took the child and nursed it. and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter and he became her son. and she called his name moses and said because i drew him out of the water. and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown up that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he saw an egyptian smiting a hebrew one of his brethren. and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he smote the egyptian and hid him in the sand. and he went out the second day and behold two men of the hebrews were striving together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us thinkest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely the thing is known.  now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses. but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well. now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock. and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon today and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and moreover he drew water for us and watered the flock. and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread. and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter. and she bare a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a sojourner in a foreign land.  and it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage. and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob. and god saw the children of israel and god took knowledge [of them]. now moses was keeping the flock of jethro his fatherinlaw the priest of midian and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness and came to the mountain of god unto horeb. and the angel of jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed. and moses said i will turn aside now and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt. and when jehovah saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses. and he said here am i. and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.  moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob. and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god. and jehovah said i have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite. and now behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me moreover i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them. come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt. and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt  and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be the token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain. and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you. and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel jehovah the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations. go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them jehovah the god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob hath appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and [seen] that which is done to you in egypt  and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey. and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him jehovah the god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to jehovah our god. and i know that the king of egypt will not give you leave to go no not by a mighty hand. and i will put forth my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go. and i will give this people favor in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty. but every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall despoil the egyptians.  and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say jehovah hath not appeared unto thee. and jehovah said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod. and he said cast in on the ground. and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it. and jehovah said unto moses put forth thy hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and laid hold of it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that jehovah the god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee. and jehovah said furthermore unto him put now thy hand into thy bosom. and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as [white as] snow. and he said put thy hand into thy bosom again. and he put his hand into his bosom again and when he took it out of his bosom behold it was turned again as his [other] flesh.  and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. and it shall come to pass if they will not believe even these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. and moses said unto jehovah oh lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant for i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue. and jehovah said unto him who hath made mans mouth or who maketh [a man] dumb or deaf or seeing or blind is it not i jehovah now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt speak. and he said oh lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against moses and he said is there not aaron thy brother the levite i know that he can speak well. and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.  and thou shalt speak unto him and put the words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do. and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee a mouth and thou shalt be to him as god. and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod wherewith thou shalt do the signs. and moses went and returned to jethro his father inlaw and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren that are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive. and jethro said to moses go in peace. and jehovah said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead that sought thy life. and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand. and jehovah said unto moses when thou goest back into egypt see that thou do before pharaoh all the wonders which i have put in thy hand but i will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith jehovah israel is my son my firstborn  and i have said unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and thou hast refused to let him go behold i will slay thy son thy firstborn. and it came to pass on the way at the lodging place that jehovah met him and sought to kill him. then zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and she said surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me. so he let him alone. then she said a bridegroom of blood [art thou] because of the circumcision. and jehovah said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses. and he went and met him in the mountain of god and kissed him. and moses told aaron all the words of jehovah wherewith he had sent him and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.  and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel and aaron spake all the words which jehovah had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. and the people believed and when they heard that jehovah had visited the children of israel and that he had seen their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped.  and afterward moses and aaron came and said unto pharaoh thus saith jehovah the god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. and pharaoh said who is jehovah that i should hearken unto his voice to let israel go i know not jehovah and moreover i will not let israel go. and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice unto jehovah our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword. and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron loose the people from their works get you unto your burdens. and pharaoh said behold the people of the land are now many and ye make them rest from their burdens.  and the same day pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves.  and the number of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish aught thereof for they are idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god. let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them not regard lying words. and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw. go yourselves get you straw where ye can find it for nought of your work shall be diminished. so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw. and the taskmasters were urgent saying fulfil your works [your] daily tasks as when there was straw. and the officers of the children of israel whom pharaohs taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to day in making brick as heretofore  then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants  there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault it in thine own people. but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and sacrifice to jehovah. go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks. and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case when it was said ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks [your] daily tasks. and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them jehovah look upon you and judge because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us. and moses returned unto jehovah and said lord wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people why is it that thou hast sent me for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath dealt ill with this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.  and jehovah said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for by a strong hand shall he let them go and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am jehovah and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob as god almighty but by my name jehovah i was not known to them. and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their sojournings wherein they sojourned. and moreover i have heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant. wherefore say unto the children of israel i am jehovah and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am jehovah your god who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians.  and i will bring you in unto the land which i sware to give to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for a heritage i am jehovah. and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage. and jehovah spake unto moses saying go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land. and moses spake before jehovah saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt. these are the heads of their fathers houses. the sons of reuben the first born of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these are the families of reuben. and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon.  and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. the sons of gershon libni and shimei according to their families. and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. and the sons of merari mahli and mushi. these are the families of the levites according to their generations. and amram took him jochebed his fathers sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri. and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and sithri. and aaron took him elisheba the daughter of amminadab the sister of nahshon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar. and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korahites.  and eleazar aarons son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas. these are the heads of the fathers [houses] of the levites according to their families. these are that aaron and moses to whom jehovah said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their hosts. these are they that spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron. and it came to pass on the day when jehovah spake unto moses in the land of egypt that jehovah spake unto moses saying i am jehovah speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i speak unto thee. and moses said before jehovah behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me and jehovah said unto moses see i have made thee as god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he let the children of israel go out of his land. and i will harden pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt.  but pharaoh will not hearken unto you and i will lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth my hosts my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments. and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah when i stretch forth my hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them. and moses and aaron did so as jehovah commanded them so did they. and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh. and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a wonder for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it down before pharaoh that it become a serpent. and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as jehovah had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent. then pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers and they also the magicians of egypt did in like manner with their enchantments.  for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aarons rod swallowed up their rods. and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as jehovah had spoken. and jehovah said unto moses pharaohs heart is stubborn he refuseth to let the people go. get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink to meet him and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. and thou shalt say unto him jehovah the god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou hast not hearkened. thus saith jehovah in this thou shalt know that i am jehovah behold i will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood. and the fish that are in the river shall die and the river shall become foul and the egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.  and jehovah said unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the waters of egypt over their rivers over their streams and over their pools and over all their ponds of water that they may become blood and there shall be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. and moses and aaron did so as jehovah commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. and the fish that were in the river died and the river became foul and the egyptians could not drink water from the river and the blood was throughout all the land of egypt. and the magicians of egypt did in like manner with their enchantments and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as jehovah had spoken. and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he lay even this to heart. and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river.  and seven days were fulfilled after that jehovah had smitten the river. and jehovah spake unto moses go in unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith jehovah let my people go that they may serve me. and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs and the river shall swarm with frogs which shall go up and come into thy house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneading troughs and the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants. and jehovah said unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers over the streams and over the pools and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt. and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt. and the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt.  then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said entreat jehovah that he take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may sacrifice unto jehovah. and moses said unto pharaoh have thou this glory over me against what time shall i entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses and remain in the river only and he said against to morrow. and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto jehovah our god. and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only. and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon pharaoh. and jehovah did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the courts and out of the fields. and they gathered them together in heaps and the land stank.  but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as jehovah had spoken. and jehovah said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the earth that is may become lice throughout all the land of egypt. and they did so and aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and there were lice upon man and upon beast all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of egypt. and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not and there were lice upon man and upon beast. then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as jehovah had spoken. and jehovah said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith jehovah let my people go that they may serve me.  else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon they servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are. and i will set apart in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that i am jehovah in the midst of the earth. and i will put a division between my people and thy people by to morrow shall this sign be. and jehovah did so and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and in all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies. and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land. and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to jehovah our god lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone us we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to jehovah our god as he shall command us.  and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to jehovah your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away entreat for me. and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will entreat jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people tomorrow only let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to jehovah. and moses went out from pharaoh and entreated jehovah. and jehovah did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one. and pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go. then jehovah said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith jehovah the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me. for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still behold the hand of jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the herds and upon the flocks [there shall be] a very grievous murrain.  and jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of israel. and jehovah appointed a set time saying to morrow jehovah shall do this thing in the land. and jehovah did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one. and pharaoh sent and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of the israelites dead. but the heart of pharaoh was stubborn and he did not let the people go. and jehovah said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of pharaoh. and it shall become small dust over all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt. and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.  and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians. and jehovah hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as jehovah had spoken unto moses. and jehovah said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith jehovah the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me. for i will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. for now i had put forth my hand and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence and thou hadst been cut off from the earth but in very deed for this cause have i made thee to stand to show thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go behold to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the day it was founded even until now.  now therefore send hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field [for] every man and beast that shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die. he that feared the word of jehovah among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses. and he that regarded not the word of jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field. and jehovah said unto moses stretch forth thy hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt. and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and jehovah sent thunder and hail and fire ran down unto the earth and jehovah rained hail upon the land of egypt. so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as had not been in all the land of egypt since it became a nation. and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field. only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail.  and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time jehovah is righteous and i and my people are wicked. entreat jehovah for there hath been enough of [these] mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer. and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto jehovah the thunders shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know that the earth is jehovahs. but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear jehovah god. and the flax and the barley were smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom. but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten for they were not grown up. and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto jehovah and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth. and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants.  and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the children of israel go as jehovah had spoken by moses.  and jehovah said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i may show these my signs in the midst of them and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons son what things i have wrought upon egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know that i am jehovah. and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith jehovah the god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me. else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring locusts into thy border and they shall cover the face of the earth so that one shall not be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field  and thy houses shall be filled and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. and he turned and went out from pharaoh.  and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve jehovah their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve jehovah your god but who are they that shall go and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto jehovah. and he said unto them so be jehovah with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you. not so go now ye that are men and serve jehovah for that is what ye desire. and they were driven out from pharaohs presence.  and jehovah said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left. and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts.  and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the borders of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such. for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing either tree or herb of the field through all the land of egypt. then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against jehovah your god and against you. now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and entreat jehovah your god that he may take away from me this death only. and he went out from pharaoh and entreated jehovah.  and jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the border of egypt. but jehovah hardened pharaohs heart and he did not let the children of israel go. and jehovah said unto moses stretch out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt. and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw not one another neither rose any one from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings. and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve jehovah only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you. and moses said thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burntofferings that we may sacrifice unto jehovah our god.  our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve jehovah our god and we know not with what we must serve jehovah until we come thither. but jehovah hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let them go. and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die. and moses said thou hast spoken well. i will see thy face again no more. and jehovah said unto moses yet one plague more will i bring upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. speak now in the ears of the people and let them ask every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor jewels of silver and jewels of gold. and jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptians. moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaohs servants and in the sight of the people. and moses said thus saith jehovah about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt  and all the first born in the land of egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of cattle. and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there hath not been nor shall be any more. but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that jehovah doth make a distinction between the egyptians and israel. and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out. and he went out from pharaoh in hot anger. and jehovah said unto moses pharaoh will not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt. and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and jehovah hardened pharaohs heart and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land. and jehovah spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying  this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you. speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to their fathers houses a lamb for a household and if the household be too little for a lamb then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls according to every mans eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. your lamb shall be without blemish a male a year old ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at even. and they shall take of the blood and put it on the two sideposts and on the lintel upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it. eat not of it raw nor boiled at all with water but roast with fire its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.  and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is jehovahs passover. for i will go through the land of egypt in that night and will smite all the first born in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgments i am jehovah. and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt. and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to jehovah throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel.  and in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation and in the seventh day a holy convocation no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done by you. and ye shall observe the [feast of] unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your hosts out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever. in the first [month] on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a sojourner or one that is born in the land. ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you lambs according to your families and kill the passover.  and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two sideposts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. for jehovah will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts jehovah will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. and it shall come to pass when ye are come to the land which jehovah will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service. and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of jehovahs passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses. and the people bowed the head and worshipped. and the children of israel went and did so as jehovah had commanded moses and aaron so did they.  and it came to pass at midnight that jehovah smote all the first born in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle. and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead. and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve jehovah as ye have said. take both your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also. and the egyptians were urgent upon the people to send them out of the land in haste for they said we are all dead men. and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they asked of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment.  and jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptians so that they let them have what they asked. and they despoiled the egyptians. and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men besides children. and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle. and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals. now the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years. and it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of jehovah went out from the land of egypt. it is a night to be much observed unto jehovah for bringing them out from the land of egypt this is that night of jehovah to be much observed of all the children of israel throughout their generations. and jehovah said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no foreigner eat thereof  but every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof. a sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof. all the congregation of israel shall keep it. and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to jehovah let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. thus did all the children of israel as jehovah commanded moses and aaron so did they. and it came to pass the selfsame day that jehovah did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts. and jehovah spake unto moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine.  and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand jehovah brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten. this day ye go forth in the month abib. and it shall be when jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month. seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to jehovah. unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders. and thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying it is because of that which jehovah did for me when i came forth out of egypt. and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the law of jehovah may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath jehovah brought thee out of egypt.  thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. and it shall be when jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt set apart unto jehovah all that openeth the womb and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast the males shall be jehovahs. and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the first born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand jehovah brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that jehovah slew all the first born in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to jehovah all that openeth the womb being males but all the firstborn of my sons i redeem.  and it shall be for a sign upon thy hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand jehovah brought us forth out of egypt. and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not by the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about by the way of the wilderness by the red sea and the children of israel went up armed out of the land of egypt. and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness. and jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light that they might go by day and by night the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  speak unto the children of israel that they turn back and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea before baal zephon over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. and pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in. and i will harden pharaohs heart and he shall follow after them and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his host and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah. and they did so. and it was told the king of egypt that the people were fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people and they said what is this we have done that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over all of them. and jehovah hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel for the children of israel went out with a high hand.  and the egyptians pursued after them all the horses [and] chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baal zephon. and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians were marching after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto jehovah. and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to bring us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we spake unto thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it were better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of jehovah which he will work for you to day for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever. jehovah will fight for you and ye shall hold your peace.  and jehovah said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward. and lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall go in after them and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen. and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen. and the angel of god who went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them and it came between the camp of egypt and the camp of israel and there was the cloud and the darkness yet gave it light by night and the one came not near the other all the night.  and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and jehovah caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided. and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left. and the egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen. and it came to pass in the morning watch that jehovah looked forth upon the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud and discomfited the host of the egyptians. and he took off their chariot wheels and they drove them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for jehovah fighteth for them against the egyptians.  and jehovah said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen.  and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and jehovah overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea. and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen even all the host of pharaoh that went in after them into the sea there remained not so much as one of them. but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left. thus jehovah saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore. and israel saw the great work which jehovah did upon the egyptians and the people feared jehovah and they believed in jehovah and in his servant moses. then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto jehovah and spake saying i will sing unto jehovah for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  jehovah is my strength and song and he is become my salvation this is my god and i will praise him my fathers god and i will exalt him. jehovah is a man of war jehovah is his name. pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea and his chosen captains are sunk in the red sea. the deeps cover them they went down into the depths like a stone. thy right hand o jehovah is glorious in power thy right hand o jehovah dasheth in pieces the enemy. and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee thou sendest forth thy wrath it consumeth them as stubble. and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up the floods stood upright as a heap the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my desire shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them. thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters.  who is like unto thee o jehovah among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders  thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them. thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. the peoples have heard they tremble pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of philistia. then were the chiefs of edom dismayed the mighty men of moab trembling taketh hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan are melted away. terror and dread falleth upon them by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone till thy people pass over o jehovah till the people pass over that thou hast purchased. thou wilt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance the place o jehovah which thou hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established. jehovah shall reign for ever and ever. for the horses of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.  and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. and miriam answered them sing ye to jehovah for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. and moses led israel onward from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah. and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink an he cried unto jehovah and jehovah showed him a tree and he cast it into the waters and the waters were made sweet. there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them  and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of jehovah thy god and wilt do that which is right in his eyes and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of the diseases upon thee which i have put upon the egyptians for i am jehovah that healeth thee. and they came to elim where were twelve springs of water and threescore and ten palmtrees and they encamped there by the waters. and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt. and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness and the children of israel said unto them would that we had died by the hand of jehovah in the land of egypt when we sat by the fleshpots when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.  then said jehovah unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a days portion every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or not. and it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that jehovah hath brought you out from the land of egypt and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of jehovah for that he heareth your murmurings against jehovah and what are we that ye murmur against us and moses said [this shall be] when jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against jehovah. and moses said unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before jehovah for he hath heard your murmurings.  and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of jehovah appeared in the cloud. and jehovah spake unto moses saying i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am jehovah your god. and it came to pass at even that the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp. and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing small as the hoarfrost on the ground. and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another what is it for they knew not what it was. and moses said unto them it is the bread which jehovah hath given you to eat. this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded gather ye of it every man according to his eating an omer a head according to the number of your persons shall ye take it every man for them that are in his tent.  and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less. and when they measured it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating. and moses said unto them let no man leave of it till the morning. notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and became foul and moses was wroth with them. and they gathered it morning by morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted. and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for each one and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses. and he said unto them this is that which jehovah hath spoken tomorrow is a solemn rest a holy sabbath unto jehovah bake that which ye will bake and boil that which ye will boil and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not become foul neither was there any worm therein.  and moses said eat that today for today is a sabbath unto jehovah today ye shall not find it in the field. six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day is the sabbath in it there shall be none. and it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out some of the people to gather and they found none. and jehovah said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws see for that jehovah hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. so the people rested on the seventh day. and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers [made] with honey. and moses said this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt.  and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omerful of manna therein and lay it up before jehovah to be kept throughout your generations. as jehovah commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept. and the children of israel did eat the manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat the manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan. now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin by their journeys according to the commandment of jehovah and encamped in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink. wherefore the people stove with moses and said give us water that we may drink. and moses said unto them why strive ye with me wherefore do ye tempt jehovah and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore hast thou brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto jehovah saying what shall i do unto this people they are almost ready to stone me.  and jehovah said unto moses pass on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and they rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thy hand and go. behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink. and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel. and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the striving of the children of israel and because they tempted jehovah saying is jehovah among us or not then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim. and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand. so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill. and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed.  but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. and jehovah said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua that i will utterly blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven. and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nissi and he said jehovah hath sworn jehovah will have war with amalek from generation to generation. now jethro the priest of midian moses fatherin law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people how that jehovah had brought israel out of egypt. and jethro moses fatherin law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her away and her two sons of whom the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been a sojourner in a foreign land  and the name of the other was eliezer for [he said] the god of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh. and jethro moses fatherin law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of god and he said unto moses i thy fatherinlaw jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her. and moses went out to meet his fatherinlaw and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent. and moses told his fatherinlaw all that jehovah had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how jehovah delivered them. and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which jehovah had done to israel in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians. and jethro said blessed be jehovah who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians.  now i know that jehovah is greater than all gods yea in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them. and jethro moses fatherin law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses fatherin law before god. and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood about moses from the morning unto the evening. and when moses fatherinlaw saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even and moses said unto his fatherin law because the people come unto me to inquire of god when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between a man and his neighbor and i make them know the statutes of god and his laws. and moses fatherinlaw said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good. thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for the thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.  hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god be with thee be thou for the people to god ward and bring thou the causes unto god and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do. moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating unjust gain and place such over them to be rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge themselves so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear [the burden] with thee. if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people also shall go to their place in peace. so moses hearkened to the voice of his fatherinlaw and did all that he had said. and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens.  and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves. and moses let his fatherinlaw depart and he went his way into his own land. in the third month after the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai. and when they were departed from rephidim and were come to the wilderness of sinai they encamped in the wilderness and there israel encamped before the mount. and moses went up unto god and jehovah called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself. now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel.  and moses came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which jehovah commanded him. and all the people answered together and said all that jehovah hath spoken we will do. and moses reported the words of the people unto jehovah. and jehovah said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and may also believe thee for ever. and moses told the words of the people unto jehovah. and jehovah said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their garments and be ready against the third day for the third day jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai. and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death no hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man he shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount.  and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their garments. and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not near a woman. and it came to pass on the third day when it was morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud and all the people that were in the camp trembled. and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet god and they stood at the nether part of the mount. and mount sinai the whole of it smoked because jehovah descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly. and when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice. and jehovah came down upon mount sinai to the top of the mount and jehovah called moses to the top of the mount and moses went up. and jehovah said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto jehovah to gaze and many of them perish.  and let the priests also that come near to jehovah sanctify themselves lest jehovah break forth upon them. and moses said unto jehovah the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou didst charge us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it. and jehovah said unto him go get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto jehovah lest he break forth upon them. so moses went down unto the people and told them. and god spake all these words saying i am jehovah thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage. thou shalt have no other gods before me. thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any likeness [of any thing] that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i jehovah thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me  and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is a sabbath unto jehovah thy god [in it] thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days jehovah made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore jehovah blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it. honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee. thou shalt not kill. thou shalt not commit adultery. thou shalt not steal. thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife nor his man servant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors.  and all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they trembled and stood afar off. and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die.  and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before you that ye sin not. and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was. and jehovah said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven. ye shall not make [other gods] with me gods of silver or gods of gold ye shall not make unto you. an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peaceofferings thy sheep and thine oxen in every place where i record my name i will come unto thee and i will bless thee. and if thou make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stones for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it.  neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon. now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. if thou buy a hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. if he come in by himself he shall go out by himself if he be married then his wife shall go out with him.  if his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself. but if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto god and shall bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him for ever. and if a man sell his daughter to be a maid servant she shall not go out as the menservants do. if she please not her master who hath espoused her to himself then shall he let her be redeemed to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. and if he espouse her unto his son he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.  if he take him another [wife] her food her raiment and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish. and if he do not these three things unto her then shall she go out for nothing without money. he that smiteth a man so that he dieth shall surely be put to death. and if a man lie not in wait but god deliver [him] into his hand then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. and if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die. and he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death. and he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death. and he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. and if men contend and one smite the other with a stone or with his fist and he die not but keep his bed if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff then shall he that smote him be quit only he shall pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. and if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod and he die under his hand he shall surely be punished.  notwithstanding if he continue a day or two he shall not be punished for he is his money. and if men strive together and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart and yet no harm follow he shall be surely fined according as the womans husband shall lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine. but if any harm follow then thou shalt give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe. and if a man smite the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid and destroy it he shall let him go free for his eyes sake. and if he smite out his man servants tooth or his maid servants tooth he shall let him go free for his tooths sake. and if an ox gore a man or a woman to death the ox shall be surely stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten but the owner of the ox shall be quit. but if the ox was wont to gore in time past and it hath been testified to its owner and he hath not kept it in but it hath killed a man or a woman the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.  if there be laid on him a ransom then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. whether it have gored a son or have gored a daughter according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. if the ox gore a manservant or a maidservant there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox shall be stoned. and if a man shall open a pit or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it and an ox or an ass fall therein the owner of the pit shall make it good he shall give money unto the owner thereof and the dead [beast] shall be his. and if one mans ox hurt anothers so that it dieth then they shall sell the live ox and divide the price of it and the dead also they shall divide. or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past and its owner hath not kept it in he shall surely pay ox for ox and the dead [beast] shall be his own. if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep. if the thief be found breaking in and be smitten so that he dieth there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.  if the sun be risen upon him there shall be bloodguiltiness for him he shall make restitution if he have nothing then he shall be sold for his theft. if the theft be found in his hand alive whether it be ox or ass or sheep he shall pay double. if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten and shall let his beast loose and it feed in another mans field of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution. if fire break out and catch in thorns so that the shocks of grain or the standing grain or the field are consumed he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. if a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep and it be stolen out of the mans house if the thief be found he shall pay double. if the thief be not found then the master of the house shall come near unto god [to see] whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbors goods. for every matter of trespass whether it be for ox for ass for sheep for raiment [or] for any manner of lost thing whereof one saith this is it the cause of both parties shall come before god he whom god shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor.  if a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep and it die or be hurt or driven away no man seeing it the oath of jehovah shall be between them both whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbors goods and the owner thereof shall accept it and he shall not make restitution. but if it be stolen from him he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. if it be torn in pieces let him bring it for witness he shall not make good that which was torn. and if a man borrow aught of his neighbor and it be hurt or die the owner thereof not being with it he shall surely make restitution. if the owner thereof be with it he shall not make it good if it be a hired thing it came for its hire. and if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed and lie with her he shall surely pay a dowry for her

that it may be a memorial for the children of israel before jehovah to make atonement for your souls. and jehovah spake unto moses saying thou shalt also make a laver of brass and the base thereof of brass whereat to wash. and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar and thou shalt put water therein. and aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat when they go into the tent of meeting they shall wash with water that they die not or when they come near to the altar to minister to burn an offering made by fire unto jehovah. so they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die not and it shall be a statute for ever to them even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. moreover jehovah spake unto moses saying take thou also unto thee the chief spices of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels] and of sweet cinnamon half so much even two hundred and fifty and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty  and of cassia five hundred after the shekel of the sanctuary and of olive oil a hin. and thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer it shall be a holy anointing oil. and thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony and the table and all the vessels thereof and the candlestick and the vessels thereof and the altar of incense and the altar of burntoffering with all the vessels thereof and the laver and the base thereof. and thou shalt sanctify them that they may be most holy whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons and sanctify them that they may minister unto me in the priests office. and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured neither shall ye make any like it according to the composition thereof it is holy [and] it shall be holy unto you. whosoever compoundeth any like it or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger he shall be cut off from his people.  and jehovah said unto moses take unto thee sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum sweet spices with pure frankincense of each shall there be a like weight and thou shalt make of it incense a perfume after the art of the perfumer seasoned with salt pure [and] holy and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where i will meet with thee it shall be unto you most holy. and the incense which thou shalt make according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves it shall be unto thee holy for jehovah. whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereof he shall be cut off from his people. and jehovah spake unto moses saying see i have called by name bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship to devise skilful works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones for setting and in carving of wood to work in all manner of workmanship.  and i behold i have appointed with him oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the heart of all that are wisehearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony and the mercyseat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tent and the table and its vessels and the pure candlestick with all its vessels and the altar of incense and the altar of burntoffering with all its vessels and the laver and its base and the finely wrought garments and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priests office and the anointing oil and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily ye shall keep my sabbaths for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am jehovah who sanctifieth you.  ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people. six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest holy to jehovah whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death. wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant. it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days jehovah made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed. and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai the two tables of the testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god.  and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down from the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him. and aaron said unto them break off the golden rings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me. and all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron. and he received it at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it a molten calf and they said these are thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt. and when aaron saw [this] he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow shall be a feast to jehovah. and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.  and jehovah spake unto moses go get thee down for thy people that thou broughtest up out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed unto it and said these are thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt. and jehovah said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation. and moses besought jehovah his god and said jehovah why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people that thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak saying for evil did he bring them forth to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people.  remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever. and jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people. and moses turned and went down from the mount with the two tables of the testimony in his hand tables that were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written. and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables. and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp. and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear. and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount.  and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it with fire and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it. and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought a great sin upon them and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are [set] on evil. for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him. and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me and i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf. and when moses saw that the people were broken loose for aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said whoso is on jehovahs side [let him come] unto me. and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him.  and he said unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel put ye every man his sword upon his thigh and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbor. and the sons of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. and moses said consecrate yourselves today to jehovah yea every man against his son and against his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto jehovah peradventure i shall make atonement for your sin. and moses returned unto jehovah and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold. yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written. and jehovah said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book.  and now go lead the people unto [the place] of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them. and jehovah smote the people because they made the calf which aaron made. and jehovah spake unto moses depart go up hence thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land of which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way. and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments.  and jehovah said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people if i go up into the midst of thee for one moment i shall consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee. and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount horeb onward. now moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp afar off from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting. and it came to pass that every one that sought jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting which was without the camp. and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tent that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tent. and it came to pass when moses entered into the tent the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent and [jehovah] spake with moses. and all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent and all the people rose up and worshipped every man at his tent door.  and jehovah spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend. and he turned again into the camp but his minister joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tent. and moses said unto jehovah see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found favor in my sight. now therefore i pray thee if i have found favor in thy sight show me now thy ways that i may know thee to the end that i may find favor in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people. and he said my presence shall go [with thee] and i will give thee rest. and he said unto him if thy presence go not [with me] carry us not up hence. for wherein now shall it be known that i have found favor in thy sight i and thy people is it not in that thou goest with us so that we are separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and jehovah said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found favor in my sight and i know thee by name. and he said show me i pray thee thy glory.  and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and will proclaim the name of jehovah before thee and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy. and he said thou canst not see my face for man shall not see me and live. and jehovah said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon the rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand until i have passed by and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back but my face shall not be seen. and jehovah said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest. and be ready by the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.  and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as jehovah had commanded him and took in his hand two tables of stone. and jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of jehovah. and jehovah passed by before him and proclaimed jehovah jehovah a god merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth keeping lovingkindness for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear [the guilty] visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the childrens children upon the third and upon the fourth generation. and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped. and he said if now i have found favor in thy sight o lord let the lord i pray thee go in the midst of us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance.  and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been wrought in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of jehovah for it is a terrible thing that i do with thee. observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite. take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and ye shall cut down their asherim for thou shalt worship no other god for jehovah whose name is jealous is a jealous god lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they play the harlot after their gods and sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters play the harlot after their gods and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods. thou shalt make thee no molten gods.  the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee at the time appointed in the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt. all that openeth the womb is mine and all thy cattle that is male the firstlings of cow and sheep. and the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck. all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. and none shall appear before me empty. six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks [even] of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years end. three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the lord jehovah the god of israel. for i will cast out nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou goest up to appear before jehovah thy god three times in the year. thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.  the first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of jehovah thy god. thou shalt not boil a kid in its mothers milk. and jehovah said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel. and he was there with jehovah forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water. and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments. and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of the testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.  and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him. and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses spake to them. and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that jehovah had spoken with him in mount sinai.  and when moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face. but when moses went in before jehovah to speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded. and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him. and moses assembled all the congregation of the children of israel and said unto them these are the words which jehovah hath commanded that ye should do them. six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day a sabbath of solemn rest to jehovah whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.  ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which jehovah commanded saying take ye from among you an offering unto jehovah whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it jehovahs offering gold and silver and brass  and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats [hair] and rams skins dyed red and sealskins and acacia wood and oil for the light and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense and onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate. and let every wisehearted man among you come and make all that jehovah hath commanded the tabernacle its tent and its covering its clasps and its boards its bars its pillars and its sockets the ark and the staves thereof the mercyseat and the veil of the screen the table and its staves and all its vessels and the

every one whose heart stirred him up and every one whom his spirit made willing [and] brought jehovahs offering for the work of the tent of meeting and for all the service thereof and for the holy garments. and they came both men and women as many as were willing hearted [and] brought brooches and earrings and signetrings and armlets all jewels of gold even every man that offered an offering of gold unto jehovah.  and every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats [hair] and rams skins dyed red and sealskins brought them. every one that did offer an

brought the onyx stones and the stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense. the children of israel brought a freewilloffering unto jehovah every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work which jehovah had commanded to be made by moses. and moses said unto the children of israel see jehovah hath called by name bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah. and he hath filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship and to devise skilful works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones for setting and in carving of wood to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.  and he hath put in his heart that he may teach both he and oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan. them hath he filled with wisdom of heart to work all manner of workmanship of the engraver and of the skilful workman and of the embroiderer in blue and in purple in scarlet and in fine linen and of the weaver even of them that do any workmanship and of those that devise skilful works. and bezalel and oholiab shall work and every wisehearted man in whom jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that jehovah hath commanded. and moses called bezalel and oholiab and every wise hearted man in whose heart jehovah had put wisdom even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it and they received of moses all the offering which the children of israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary wherewith to make it. and they brought yet unto him freewill offerings every morning. and all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they wrought.  and they spake unto moses saying the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which jehovah commanded to make. and moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. so the people were restrained from bringing. for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much. and all the wise hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubim the work of the skilful workman [bezalel]

trespassoffering and of the consecration and of the sacrifice of peaceofferings which jehovah commanded moses in mount sinai in the day that he commanded the children of israel to offer their oblations unto jehovah in the wilderness of sinai. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  take aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and the bullock of the sinoffering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting. and moses did as jehovah commanded him and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. and moses said unto the congregation this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded to be done. and moses brought aaron and his sons and washed them with water. and he put upon him the coat and girded him with the girdle and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith. and he placed the breastplate upon him and in the breastplate he put the urim and the thummim. and he set the mitre upon his head and upon the mitre in front did he set the golden plate the holy crown as jehovah commanded moses. and moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein and sanctified them.  and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its vessels and the laver and its base to sanctify them. and he poured of the anointing oil upon aarons head and anointed him to sanctify him. and moses brought aarons sons and clothed them with coats and girded them with girdles and bound headtires upon them as jehovah commanded moses. and he brought the bullock of the sinoffering and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin offering. and he slew it and moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and sanctified it to make atonement for it. and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and moses burned it upon the altar. but the bullock and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burnt with fire without the camp as jehovah commanded moses. and he presented the ram of the burnt offering and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.  and he killed it and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. and he cut the ram into its pieces and moses burnt the head and the pieces and the fat. and he washed the inwards and the legs with water and moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar it was a burntoffering for a sweet savor it was an offering made by fire unto jehovah as jehovah commanded moses. and he presented the other ram the ram of consecration and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. and he slew it and moses took of the blood thereof and put it upon the tip of aarons right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot. and he brought aarons sons and moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear and upon the thumb of their right hand and upon the great toe of their right foot and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. and he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh  and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before jehovah he took one unleavened cake and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer and placed them on the fat and upon the right thigh and he put the whole upon the hands of aaron and upon the hands of his sons and waved them for a wave offering before jehovah. and moses took them from off their hands and burnt them on the altar upon the burntoffering they were a consecration for a sweet savor it was an offering made by fire unto jehovah. and moses took the breast and waved it for a waveoffering before jehovah it was moses portion of the ram of consecration as jehovah commanded moses. and moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar and sprinkled it upon aaron upon his garments and upon his sons and upon his sons garments with him and sanctified aaron his garments and his sons and his sons garments with him.  and moses said unto aaron and to his sons boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration as i commanded saying aaron and his sons shall eat it. and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. and ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days until the days of your consecration be fulfilled for he shall consecrate you seven days. as hath been done this day so jehovah hath commanded to do to make atonement for you. and at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days and keep the charge of jehovah that ye die not for so i am commanded. and aaron and his sons did all the things which jehovah commanded by moses. and it came to pass on the eighth day that moses called aaron and his sons and the elders of israel and he said unto aaron take thee a calf of the herd for a sinoffering and a ram for a burntoffering without blemish and offer them before jehovah.  and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak saying take ye a hegoat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both a year old without blemish for a burnt offering and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before jehovah and a mealoffering mingled with oil for today jehovah appeareth unto you. and they brought that which moses commanded before the tent of meeting and all the congregation drew near and stood before jehovah. and moses said this is the thing which jehovah commanded that ye should do and the glory of jehovah shall appear unto you. and moses said unto aaron draw near unto the altar and offer thy sinoffering and thy burnt offering and make atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the oblation of the people and make atonement for them as jehovah commanded. so aaron drew near unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself. and the sons of aaron presented the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar  but the fat and the kidneys and the caul from the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as jehovah commanded moses. and the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp. and he slew the burntoffering and aarons sons delivered unto him the blood and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. and they delivered the burntoffering unto him piece by piece and the head and he burnt them upon the altar. and he washed the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burntoffering on the altar. and he presented the peoples oblation and took the goat of the sinoffering which was for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first. and he presented the burntoffering and offered it according to the ordinance. and he presented the mealoffering and filled his hand therefrom and burnt it upon the altar besides the burntoffering of the morning. he slew also the ox and the ram the sacrifice of peaceofferings which was for the people and aarons sons delivered unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about  and the fat of the ox and of the ram the fat tail and that which covereth [the inwards] and the kidneys and the caul of the liver and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar and the breasts and the right thigh aaron waved for a waveoffering before jehovah as moses commanded. and aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burntoffering and the peace offerings. and moses and aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people and the glory of jehovah appeared unto all the people. and there came forth fire from before jehovah and consumed upon the altar the burntoffering and the fat and when all the people saw it they shouted and fell on their faces. and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took each of them his censer and put fire therein and laid incense thereon and offered strange fire before jehovah which he had not commanded them. and there came forth fire from before jehovah and devoured them and they died before jehovah.  then moses said unto aaron this is it that jehovah spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified. and aaron held his peace. and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them draw near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. so they drew near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said. and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons let not the hair of your heads go loose neither rend your clothes that ye die not and that he be not wroth with all the congregation but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which jehovah hath kindled.  and ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting lest ye die for the anointing oil of jehovah is upon you. and they did according to the word of moses. and jehovah spake unto aaron saying drink no wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tent of meeting that ye die not it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations  and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which jehovah hath spoken unto them by moses. and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of jehovah made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy and ye shall eat it in a holy place because it is thy portion and thy sons portion of the offerings of jehovah made by fire for so i am commanded. and the wave breast and the heavethigh shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they are given as thy portion and thy sons portion out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of israel.  the heavethigh and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a waveoffering before jehovah and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee as a portion for ever as jehovah hath commanded.  and moses diligently sought the goat of the sinoffering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and with ithamar the sons of aaron that were left saying wherefore have ye not eaten the sinoffering in the place of the sanctuary seeing it is most holy and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before jehovah behold the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary as i commanded. and aaron spake unto moses behold this day have they offered their sinoffering and their burnt offering before jehovah and there have befallen me such things as these and if i had eaten the sinoffering today would it have been well pleasing in the sight of jehovah and when moses heard [that] it was wellpleasing in his sight. and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them  speak unto the children of israel saying these are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted [and] cheweth the cud among the beasts that may ye eat.  nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that part the hoof the camel because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof he is unclean unto you. and the coney because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof he is unclean unto you. and the hare because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof she is unclean unto you. and the swine because he parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted but cheweth not the cud he is unclean unto you. of their flesh ye shall not eat and their carcasses ye shall not touch they are unclean unto you. these may ye eat of all that are in the waters whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters in the seas and in the rivers that may ye eat. and all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers of all that move in the waters and of all the living creatures that are in the waters they are an abomination unto you and they shall be an abomination unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination. whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters that is an abomination unto you.  and these ye shall have in abomination among the birds they shall not be eaten they are an abomination the eagle and the giereagle and the ospray and the kite and the falcon after its kind every raven after its kind and the ostrich and the night hawk and the seamew and the hawk after its kind and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl and the horned owl and the pelican and the vulture and the stork the heron after its kind and the hoopoe and the bat. all winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you. yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours which have legs above their feet wherewith to leap upon the earth. even these of them ye may eat the locust after its kind and the bald locust after its kind and the cricket after its kind and the grasshopper after its kind. but all winged creeping things which have four feet are an abomination unto you. and by these ye shall become unclean whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even  and whosoever beareth [aught] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even. every beast which parteth the hoof and is not clovenfooted nor cheweth the cud is unclean unto you every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. and whatsoever goeth upon its paws among all beasts that go on all fours they are unclean unto you whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even. and he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even they are unclean unto you. and these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard after its kind and the gecko and the land crocodile and the lizard and the sandlizard and the chameleon. these are they which are unclean to you among all that creep whosoever doth touch them when they are dead shall be unclean until the even.  and upon whatsoever any of them when they are dead doth fall it shall be unclean whether it be any vessel of wood or raiment or skin or sack whatsoever vessel it be wherewith any work is done it must be put into water and it shall be unclean until the even then shall it be clean. and every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth whatsoever is in it shall be unclean and it ye shall break. all food [therein] which may be eaten that on which water cometh shall be unclean and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean. and every thing whereupon [any part] of their carcass falleth shall be unclean whether oven or range for pots it shall be broken in pieces they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you. nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean. and if [aught] of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown it is clean. but if water be put upon the seed and [aught] of their carcass fall thereon it is unclean unto you. and if any beast of which ye may eat die he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.  and he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even. and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination it shall not be eaten. whatsoever goeth upon the belly and whatsoever goeth upon all fours or whatsoever hath many feet even all creeping things that creep upon the earth them ye shall not eat for they are an abomination. ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them that ye should be defiled thereby. for i am jehovah your god sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy for i am holy neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth. for i am jehovah that brought you up out of the land of egypt to be your god ye shall therefore be holy for i am holy. this is the law of the beast and of the bird and of every living creature that moveth in the waters and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth  to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman conceive seed and bear a manchild then she shall be unclean seven days as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. and she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying three and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. but if she bear a maidchild then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her impurity and she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying threescore and six days. and when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or for a daughter she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sinoffering unto the door of the tent of meeting unto the priest  and he shall offer it before jehovah and make atonement for her and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. this is the law for her that beareth whether a male or a female. and if her means suffice not for a lamb then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons the one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering and the priest shall make atonement for her and she shall be clean. and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising or a scab or a bright spot and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy then he shall be brought unto aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priests and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh and if the hair in the plague be

and the priest shall take one of the helambs and offer him for a trespass offering and the log of oil and wave them for a waveoffering before jehovah and he shall kill the helamb in the place where

plague of leprosy who is not able to get [that which pertaineth] to his cleansing.  and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when ye are come into the land of canaan which i give to you for a possession and i put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest saying there seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house. and the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goeth in to see the plague that all that is in the house be not made unclean and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house and he shall look on the plague and behold if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks greenish or reddish and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.  and the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look and behold if the plague be spread in the walls of the house then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is and cast them into an unclean place without the city and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about and they shall pour out the mortar that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place and they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house. and if the plague come again and break out in the house after that he hath taken out the stones and after he hath scraped the house and after it is plastered then the priest shall come in and look and behold if the plague be spread in the house it is a fretting leprosy in the house it is unclean. and he shall break down the house the stones of it and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.  and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. and if the priest shall come in and look and behold the plague hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the plague is healed. and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water and he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water and sprinkle the house seven times and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water and with the living bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet but he shall let got the living bird out of the city into the open field so shall he make atonement for the house and it shall be clean. this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and for a scall and for the leprosy of a garment and for a house  and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean this is the law of leprosy. and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when any man hath an issue out of his flesh because of his issue he is unclean. and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue whether his flesh run with his issue or his flesh be stopped from his issue it is his uncleanness. every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean. and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even.  and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean. and whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth without having rinsed his hands in water he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and the earthen vessel which he that hath the issue toucheth shall be broken and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing and wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in running water and shall be clean. and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle doves or two young pigeons and come before jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting and give them unto the priest  and the priest shall offer them the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make atonement for him before jehovah for his issue. and if any mans seed of copulation go out from him then he shall bathe all his flesh in water and be unclean until the even. and every garment and every skin whereon is the seed of copulation shall be washed with water and be unclean until the even. the woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the even. and if a woman have an issue [and] her issue in her flesh be blood she shall be in her impurity seven days and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. and everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. and whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even.  and if it be on the bed or on anything whereon she sitteth when he toucheth it he shall be unclean until the even. and if any man lie with her and her impurity be upon him he shall be unclean seven days and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity she is unclean. every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her impurity. and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even. but if she be cleansed of her issue then she shall number to herself seven days and after that she shall be clean. and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them unto the priest to the door of the tent of meeting.  and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make atonement for her before jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness. thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their uncleanness that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them. this is the law of him that hath an issue and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him so that he is unclean thereby and of her that is sick with her impurity and of him that hath an issue of the man and of the woman and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. and jehovah spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of aaron when they drew near before jehovah and died and jehovah said unto moses speak unto aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercyseat which is upon the ark that he die not for i will appear in the cloud upon the mercyseat. herewith shall aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.  he shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh and shall be girded with the linen girdle and with the linen mitre shall he be attired they are the holy garments and he shall bathe his flesh in water and put them on. and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two he goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering. and aaron shall present the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his house. and he shall take the two goats and set them before jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting. and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats one lot for jehovah and the other lot for azazel. and aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for jehovah and offer him for a sinoffering. but the goat on which the lot fell for azazel shall be set alive before jehovah to make atonement for him to send him away for azazel into the wilderness. and aaron shall present the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself  and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before jehovah and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the veil and he shall put the incense upon the fire before jehovah that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not and he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercyseat on the east and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. then shall he kill the goat of the sinoffering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercyseat and he shall make atonement for the holy place because of the uncleannesses of the children of israel and because of their transgressions even all their sins and so shall he do for the tent of meeting that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.  and there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place until he come out and have made atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of israel. and he shall go out unto the altar that is before jehovah and make atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bullock and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of israel. and when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar he shall present the live goat and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions even all their sins and he shall put them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.  and aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place and shall leave them there and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come forth and offer his burntoffering and the burntoffering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people. and the fat of the sinoffering shall he burn upon the altar. and he that letteth go the goat for azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp. and the bullock of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place shall be carried forth without the camp and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung. and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp.  and it shall be a statute for ever unto you in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month ye shall afflict your souls and shall do no manner of work the home born or the stranger that sojourneth among you for on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you from all your sins shall ye be clean before jehovah. it is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you and ye shall afflict your souls it is a statute for ever. and the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his fathers stead shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen garments even the holy garments and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make atonement for the children of israel because of all their sins once in the year. and he did as jehovah commanded moses. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and unto his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto them this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded saying what man soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that killeth it without the camp and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting to offer it as an oblation unto jehovah before the tabernacle of jehovah blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people to the end that the children of israel may bring their sacrifices which they sacrifice in the open field even that they may bring them unto jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting unto the priest and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peaceofferings unto jehovah. and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto jehovah. and they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he goats after which they play the harlot. this shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.  and thou shalt say unto them whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among them that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting to sacrifice it unto jehovah that man shall be cut off from his people. and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among them that eateth any manner of blood i will set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people. for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among them who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten he shall pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust.  for as to the life of all flesh the blood thereof is [all one] with the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. and every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself or that which is torn of beasts whether he be homeborn or a sojourner he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean. but if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear his iniquity. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them i am jehovah your god. after the doings of the land of egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do and after the doings of the land of canaan whither i bring you shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their statutes. mine ordinances shall ye do and my statutes shall ye keep to walk therein i am jehovah your god. ye

neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god i am jehovah. thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination. and thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto it is confusion.  defile not ye yourselves in any of these things for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out from before you and the land is defiled therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances and shall not do any of these abominations neither the home born nor the stranger that sojourneth among you for all these abominations have the men of the land done that were before you and the land is defiled that the land vomit not you out also when ye defile it as it vomited out the nation that was before you.  for whosoever shall do any of these abominations even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. therefore shall ye keep my charge that ye practise not any of these abominable customs which were practised before you and that ye defile not yourselves therein i am jehovah your god. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto all the congregation of the children of israel and say unto them ye shall be holy for i jehovah your god am holy.  ye shall fear every man his mother and

at all on the third day it is an abomination it shall not be accepted but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity because he hath profaned the holy thing of jehovah and that soul shall be cut off from his people.  and when ye reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner i am jehovah your god. ye shall not steal neither shall ye deal falsely nor

people neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor i am jehovah. thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor and not bear sin because of him. thou

gender with a diverse kind thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.  and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman that is a bondmaid betrothed to a husband and not at all redeemed nor freedom given her they shall be punished they shall not be put to death because she was not free. and he shall bring his trespassoffering unto jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting even a ram for a trespassoffering. and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him. and when ye shall come into the land and shall have planted all manner of trees for food then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you it shall not be eaten. but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy for giving praise unto jehovah. and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof that it may yield unto you the increase thereof i am jehovah your god. ye shall not eat anything with the blood neither shall ye use enchantments nor practise augury.  ye shall not round the corners of your heads neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am jehovah. profane not thy daughter to make her a harlot lest the land fall to whoredom and the land become full of wickedness. ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i

face of the old man and thou shalt fear thy god i am jehovah. and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not do him wrong. the stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home born among you and thou shalt love him as thyself for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt i am jehovah your god. ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment in measures of length of weight or of quantity.  just balances just weights a just ephah and a just hin shall ye have i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt. and ye shall observe all my statutes and all mine ordinances and do them i am jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying moreover thou shalt say to the children of israel whosoever he be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn in israel that giveth of his seed unto molech he shall surely be put to death the people of the land shall stone him with stones. i also will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because he hath given of his seed unto molech to defile my sanctuary and to profane my holy name. and if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man when he giveth of his seed unto molech and put him not to death then i will set my face against that man and against his family and will cut him off and all that play the harlot after him to play the harlot with molech from among their people.  and the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards to play the harlot after them i will even set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among his people. sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy for i am jehovah your god. and ye shall keep my statutes and do them i am jehovah who sanctifieth you. for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death he hath cursed his father or his mother his blood shall be upon him. and the man that committeth adultery with another mans wife even he

of them shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them. and if a man lie with his daughter inlaw both of them shall surely be put to death they have wrought confusion their blood shall be upon them. and if a man lie with mankind as with womankind both of them have committed abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them.  and if a man take a wife and her mother it is wickedness they shall be burnt with fire both he and they that there be no wickedness among you. and if a man lie with a beast he shall surely be put to death and ye shall slay the beast. and if a woman approach unto any beast and lie down thereto thou shalt kill the woman and the beast they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them. and if a man shall take his sister his fathers daughter or his mothers daughter and see her nakedness and she see his nakedness it is a shameful thing and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people he hath uncovered his sisters nakedness he shall bear his iniquity. and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and shall uncover her nakedness he hath made naked her fountain and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister nor of thy fathers sister for he hath made naked his near kin they shall bear their iniquity.  and if a man shall lie with his uncles wife he hath uncovered his uncles nakedness they shall bear their sin they shall die childless. and if a man shall take his brothers wife it is impurity he hath uncovered his brothers nakedness they shall be childless. ye shall therefore keep all my statutes and all mine ordinances and do them that the land whither i bring you to dwell therein vomit you not out. and ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which i cast out before you for they did all these things and therefore i abhorred them. but i have said unto you ye shall inherit their land and i will give it unto you to possess it a land flowing with milk and honey i am jehovah your god who hath separated you from the peoples. ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean and between the unclean fowl and the clean and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by bird or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth which i have separated from you as unclean. and ye shall be holy unto me for i jehovah am holy and have set you apart from the peoples that ye should be mine.  a man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them. and jehovah said unto moses speak unto the priests the sons of aaron and say unto them there shall none defile himself for the dead among his people except for his kin that is near unto him for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother and for his sister a virgin that is near unto him that hath had no husband for her may he defile himself. he shall not defile himself [being] a chief man among his people to profane himself. they shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh. they shall be holy unto their god and not profane the name of their god for the offerings of jehovah made by fire the bread of their god they do offer therefore they shall be holy. they shall not take a woman that is a harlot or profane neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto his god.  thou shalt sanctify him therefore for he offereth the bread of thy god he shall be holy unto thee for i jehovah who sanctify you am holy. and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing the harlot she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire. and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil is poured and that is consecrated to put on the garments shall not let the hair of his head go loose nor rend his clothes neither shall he go in to any dead body nor defile himself for his father or for his mother neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the crown of the anointing oil of his god is upon him i am jehovah. and he shall take a wife in her virginity. a widow or one divorced or a profane woman a harlot these shall he not take but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. and he shall not profane his seed among his people for i am jehovah who sanctifieth him. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron saying whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god. for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish he shall not approach a blind man or a lame or he that hath a flat nose or anything superfluous or a man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded or crookbacked or a dwarf or that hath a blemish in his eye or is scurvy or scabbed or hath his stones broken no man of the seed of aaron the priest that hath a blemish shall come nigh to offer the offerings of jehovah made by fire he hath a blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god. he shall eat the bread of his god both of the most holy and of the holy only he shall not go in unto the veil nor come nigh unto the altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries for i am jehovah who sanctifieth them. so moses spake unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of israel. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of israel which they hallow unto me and that they profane not my holy name i am jehovah. say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations that approacheth unto the holy things which the children of israel hallow unto jehovah having his uncleanness upon him that soul shall be cut off from before me i am jehovah. what man soever of the seed of aaron is a leper or hath an issue he shall not eat of the holy things until he be clean. and whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead or a man whose seed goeth from him or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing whereby he may be made unclean or a man of whom he may take uncleanness whatsoever uncleanness he hath the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even and shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathe his flesh in water. and when the sun is down he shall be clean and afterward he shall eat of the holy things because it is his bread.  that which dieth of itself or is torn of beasts he shall not eat to defile himself therewith i am jehovah. they shall therefore keep my charge lest they bear sin for it and die therein if they profane it i am jehovah who sanctifieth them. there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of the priests or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing. but if a priest buy any soul the purchase of his money he shall eat of it and such as are born in his house they shall eat of his bread. and if a priests daughter be married unto a stranger she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things. but if a priests daughter be a widow or divorced and have no child and be returned unto her fathers house as in her youth she shall eat of her fathers bread but there shall no stranger eat thereof. and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel which they offer unto jehovah  and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt when they eat their holy things for i am jehovah who sanctifieth them. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto them whosoever he be of the house of israel or of the sojourners in israel that offereth his oblation whether it be any of their vows or any of their freewill offerings which they offer unto jehovah for a burntoffering that ye may be accepted [ye shall offer] a male without blemish of the bullocks of the sheep or of the goats. but whatsoever hath a blemish that shall ye not offer for it shall not be acceptable for you. and whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peaceofferings unto jehovah to accomplish a vow or for a freewilloffering of the herd or of the flock it shall be perfect to be accepted there shall be no blemish therein. blind or broken or maimed or having a wen or scurvy or scabbed ye shall not offer these unto jehovah nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto jehovah.  either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts that mayest thou offer for a freewilloffering but for a vow it shall not be accepted. that which hath its stones bruised or crushed or broken or cut ye shall not offer unto jehovah neither shall ye do [thus] in your land. neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your god of any of these because their corruption is in them there is a blemish in them they shall not be accepted for you. and jehovah spake unto moses saying when a bullock or a sheep or a goat is brought forth then it shall be seven days under the dam and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto jehovah. and whether it be cow or ewe ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. and when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto jehovah ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. on the same day it shall be eaten ye shall leave none of it until the morning i am jehovah. therefore shall ye keep my commandments and do them i am jehovah.  and ye shall not profane my holy name but i will be hallowed among the children of israel i am jehovah who halloweth you who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them the set feasts of jehovah which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my set feasts. six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest a holy convocation ye shall do no manner of work it is a sabbath unto jehovah in all your dwellings. these are the set feasts of jehovah even holy convocations which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even is jehovahs passover. and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto jehovah seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. in the first day ye shall have a holy convocation ye shall do no servile work.  but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah seven days in the seventh day is a holy convocation ye shall do no servile work. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are come into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before jehovah to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. and in the day when ye wave the sheaf ye shall offer a he lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering unto jehovah. and the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil an offering made by fire unto jehovah for a sweet savor and the drinkoffering thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of a hin. and ye shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor fresh ears until this selfsame day until ye have brought the oblation of your god it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.  and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waveoffering seven sabbaths shall there be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days and ye shall offer a new mealoffering unto jehovah. ye shall bring out of your habitations two waveloaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah] they shall be of fine flour they shall be baken with leaven for first fruits unto jehovah. and ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old and

for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.  and when ye reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner i am jehovah your god. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying in the seventh month on the first day of the month shall be a solemn rest unto you a memorial of blowing of trumpets a holy convocation. ye shall do no servile work and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall afflict your souls and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah. and ye shall do no manner of work in that same day for it is a day of atonement to make atonement for you before jehovah your god.  for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from his people. and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day that soul will i destroy from among his people.  ye shall do no manner of work it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. it shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest and ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month at even from even unto even shall ye keep your sabbath. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying on the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto jehovah. on the first day shall be a holy convocation ye shall do no servile work. seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah it is a solemn assembly ye shall do no servile work.  these are the set feasts of jehovah which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations to offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah a burnt offering and a mealoffering a sacrifice and drinkofferings each on its own day besides the sabbaths of jehovah and besides your gifts and besides all your vows and besides all your freewill offerings which ye give unto jehovah.  howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land ye shall keep the feast of jehovah seven days on the first day shall be a solemn rest and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. and ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees branches of palmtrees and boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook and ye shall rejoice before jehovah your god seven days. and ye shall keep it a feast unto jehovah seven days in the year it is a statute for ever throughout your generations ye shall keep it in the seventh month. ye shall dwell in booths seven days all that are homeborn in israel shall dwell in booths  that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am jehovah your god. and moses declared unto the children of israel the set feasts of jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying command the children of israel that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light to cause a lamp to burn continually. without the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting shall aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before jehovah continually it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. he shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before jehovah continually. and thou shalt take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake. and thou shalt set them in two rows six on a row upon the pure table before jehovah. and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row that it may be to the bread for a memorial even an offering made by fire unto jehovah.  every sabbath day he shall set it in order before jehovah continually it is on the behalf of the children of israel an everlasting covenant. and it shall be for aaron and his sons and they shall eat it in a holy place for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute. and the son of an israelitish woman whose father was an egyptian went out among the children of israel and the son of the israelitish woman and a man of israel strove together in the camp and the son of the israelitish woman blasphemed the name and cursed and they brought him unto moses. and his mothers name was shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan. and they put him in ward that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head and let all the congregation stone him. and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin.  and he that blasphemeth the name of jehovah he shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall certainly stone him as well the sojourner as the homeborn when he blasphemeth the name [of jehovah] shall be put to death. and he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death. and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good life for life. and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor as he hath done so shall it be done to him breach for breach eye for eye tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so shall it be rendered unto him. and he that killeth a beast shall make it good and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. ye shall have one manner of law as well for the sojourner as for the home born for i am jehovah your god. and moses spake to the children of israel and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stoned him with stones. and the children of israel did as jehovah commanded moses. and jehovah spake unto moses in mount sinai saying  speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto jehovah. six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruits thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land a sabbath unto jehovah thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard. that which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. and the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger who sojourn with thee. and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be for food. and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years even forty and nine years.  then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family. a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather [the grapes] in it of the undressed vines. for it is a jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. in this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. and if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor or buy of thy neighbors hand ye shall not wrong one another. according to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor [and] according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.  according to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee. and ye shall not wrong one another but thou shalt fear thy god for i am jehovah your god. wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. and the land shall yield its fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety. and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years. and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat of the fruits the old store until the ninth year until its fruits come in ye shall eat the old store. and the land shall not be sold in perpetuity for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.  if thy brother be waxed poor and sell some of his possession then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. and if a man have no one to redeem it and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it and he shall return unto his possession. but if he be not able to get it back for himself then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee and in the jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession. and if a man sell a dwellinghouse in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubilee. but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubilee.  nevertheless the cities of the levites the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time. and if one of the levites redeem then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the jubilee for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel. but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession. and if thy brother be waxed poor and his hand fail with thee then thou shalt uphold him [as] a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee. take thou no interest of him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee. thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest nor give him thy victuals for increase. i am jehovah your god who brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan [and] to be your god. and if thy brother be waxed poor with thee and sell himself unto thee thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond servant. as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee  then shall he go out from thee he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. for they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen. thou shalt not rule over him with rigor but shalt fear thy god. and as for thy bondmen and thy bondmaids whom thou shalt have of the nations that are round about you of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you which they have begotten in your land and they shall be your possession. and ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you to hold for a possession of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigor. and if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich and thy brother be waxed poor beside him and sell himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner with thee or to the stock of the strangers family after that he is sold he may be redeemed one of his brethren may redeem him  or his uncle or his uncles son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be waxed rich he may redeem himself. and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. if there be yet many years according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee then he shall reckon with him according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. as a servant hired year by year shall he be with him he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight. and if he be not redeemed by these [means] then he shall go out in the year of jubilee he and his children with him. for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am jehovah your god.  ye shall make you no idols neither shall ye rear you up a graven image or a pillar neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am jehovah your god. ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am jehovah. if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them then i will give your rains in their season and the land shall yield its increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely. and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land. and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword. and five of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. and i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will establish my covenant with you.  and ye shall eat old store long kept and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. and i will set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you. and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people. i am jehovah your god who brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bars of your yoke and made you go upright. but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments and if ye shall reject my statutes and if your soul abhor mine ordinances so that ye will not do all my commandments but break my covenant i also will do this unto you i will appoint terror over you even consumption and fever that shall consume the eyes and make the soul to pine away and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it. and i will set my face against you and ye shall be smitten before your enemies they that hate you shall rule over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. and if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me then i will chastise you seven times more for your sins.  and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield its increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. and i will send the beast of the field among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your ways shall become desolate. and if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me but will walk contrary unto me then will i also walk contrary unto you and i will smite you even i seven times for your sins. and i will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant and ye shall be gathered together within your cities and i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. when i break your staff of bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied.  and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me then i will walk contrary unto you in wrath and i also will chastise you seven times for your sins. and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. and i will destroy your high places and cut down your sunimages and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols and my soul shall abhor you. and i will make your cities a waste and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. and you will i scatter among the nations and i will draw out the sword after you and your land shall be a desolation and your cities shall be a waste. then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye are in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy its sabbaths. as long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it.  and as for them that are left of you i will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as one fleeth from the sword and they shall fall when none pursueth. and they shall stumble one upon another as it were before the sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. and ye shall perish among the nations and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. and they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their trespass which they trespassed against me and also that because they walked contrary unto me i also walked contrary unto them and brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity  then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land. the land also shall be left by them and shall enjoy its sabbaths while it lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they rejected mine ordinances and their soul abhorred my statutes. and yet for all that when they are in the land of their enemies i will not reject them neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am jehovah their god but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the nations that i might be their god i am jehovah. these are the statutes and ordinances and laws which jehovah made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by moses. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall accomplish a vow the persons shall be for jehovah by thy estimation.  and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary. and if it be a female then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels. and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. and if it be from sixty years old and upward if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.  but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall be set before the priest and the priest shall value him according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him. and if it be a beast whereof men offer an oblation unto jehovah all that any man giveth of such unto jehovah shall be holy.  he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer an oblation unto jehovah then he shall set the beast before the priest and the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad as thou the priest valuest it so shall it be. but if he will indeed redeem it then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto jehovah then the priest shall estimate it whether it be good or bad as the priest shall estimate it so shall it stand. and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be his.  and if a man shall sanctify unto jehovah part of the field of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof the sowing of a homer of barley [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver. if he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee according to thy estimation it shall stand.  but if he sanctify his field after the jubilee then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation. and if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to him. and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more but the field when it goeth out in the jubilee shall be holy unto jehovah as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priests. and if he sanctify unto jehovah a field which he hath bought which is not of the field of his possession then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee and he shall give thine estimation in that day as a holy thing unto jehovah.  in the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.  only the firstling among beasts which is made a firstling to jehovah no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is jehovahs. and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto jehovah of all that he hath whether of man or beast or of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto jehovah. no one devoted that shall be devoted from among men shall be ransomed he shall surely be put to death. and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is jehovahs it is holy unto jehovah. and if a man will redeem aught of his tithe he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. and all the tithe of the herd or the flock whatsoever passeth under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto jehovah.  he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy it shall not be redeemed. these are the commandments which jehovah commanded moses for the children of israel in mount sinai. and jehovah spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel by their families by their fathers houses according to the number of the names every male by their polls from twenty years old and upward all that are able to go forth to war in

declared their pedigrees after their families by their fathers houses according to the number of the names from twenty years old and upward by their polls. as jehovah commanded moses so he numbered

houses from twenty years old and upward all that were able to go forth to war in israel even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. but the levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. for jehovah spake unto moses saying only the tribe of levi thou shalt not number neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of israel  but appoint thou the levites over the tabernacle of the testimony and over all the furniture thereof and over all that belongeth to it they shall bear the tabernacle and all the furniture thereof and they shall minister unto it and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. and when the tabernacle setteth forward the levites shall take it down and when the tabernacle is

the work of service and the work of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting even those that were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. according to the commandment of jehovah they were numbered by moses every one according to his service and according to his burden thus were they numbered of him as jehovah commanded moses. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  command the children of israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that hath an issue and whosoever is unclean by the dead both male and female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they defile not their camp in the midst whereof i dwell. and the children of israel did so and put them out without the camp as jehovah spake unto moses so did the children of israel. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit so as to trespass against jehovah and that soul shall be guilty then he shall confess his sin which he hath done and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty. but if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt the restitution for guilt which is made unto jehovah shall be the priests besides the ram of the atonement whereby atonement shall be made for him. and every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they present unto the priest shall be his.  and every mans hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any mans wife go aside and commit a trespass against him and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her and she be not taken in the act and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and shall bring her oblation for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is a mealoffering of jealousy a meal offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance. and the priest shall bring her near and set her before jehovah and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water.  and the priest shall set the woman before jehovah and let the hair of the womans head go loose and put the mealoffering of memorial in her hands which is the meal offering of jealousy and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse. and the priest shall cause her to swear and shall say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness being under thy husband be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse. but if thou have gone aside being under thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away and thy body to swell and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels and make thy body to swell and thy thigh to fall away. and the woman shall say amen amen. and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness  and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her [and become] bitter. and the priest shall take the mealoffering of jealousy out of the womans hand and shall wave the meal offering before jehovah and bring it unto the altar and the priest shall take a handful of the mealoffering as the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. and when he hath made her drink the water then it shall come to pass if she be defiled and have committed a trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her [and become] bitter and her body shall swell and her thigh shall fall away and the woman shall be a curse among her people. and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seed. this is the law of jealousy when a wife being under her husband goeth aside and is defiled  or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man and he is jealous of his wife then shall he set the woman before jehovah and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. and the man shall be free from iniquity and that woman shall bear her iniquity. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall make a special vow the vow of a nazirite to separate himself unto jehovah he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any juice of grapes nor eat fresh grapes or dried. all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grapevine from the kernels even to the husk. all the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in which he separateth himself unto jehovah he shall be holy he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. all the days that he separateth himself unto jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.  he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because his separation unto god is upon his head. all the days of his separation he is holy unto jehovah. and if any man die very suddenly beside him and he defile the head of his separation then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it. and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tent of meeting and the priest shall offer one for a sinoffering and the other for a burntoffering and make atonement for him for that he sinned by reason of the dead and shall hallow his head that same day. and he shall separate unto jehovah the days of his separation and shall bring a helamb a year old for a trespassoffering but the former days shall be void because his separation was defiled. and this is the law of the nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting  and he shall offer his oblation unto jehovah one he lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewelamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peaceofferings and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and their mealoffering and their drink offerings. and the priest shall present them before jehovah and shall offer his sin offering and his burntoffering and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peaceofferings unto jehovah with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also the mealoffering thereof and the drinkoffering thereof. and the nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peaceofferings. and the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the nazirite after he hath shaven [the head of] his separation  and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before jehovah this is holy for the priest together with the wave breast and heavethigh and after that the nazirite may drink wine. this is the law of the nazirite who voweth [and of] his oblation unto jehovah for his separation besides that which he is able to get according to his vow which he voweth so he must do after the law of his separation. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel ye shall say unto them jehovah bless thee and keep thee jehovah make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. so shall they put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them. and it came to pass on the day that moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle and had anointed it and sanctified it and all the furniture thereof and the altar and all the vessels thereof and had anointed them and sanctified them  that the princes of israel the heads of their fathers houses offered. these were the princes of the tribes these are they that were over them that were numbered and they brought their oblation before jehovah six covered wagons and twelve oxen a wagon for every

meeting and thou shalt give them unto the levites to every man according to his service. and moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them unto the levites. two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of gershon according to their service and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of merari according unto their service under the hand of ithamar the son of aaron the priest. but

upon the levites and aaron shall offer the levites before jehovah for a wave offering on the behalf of the children of israel that it may be theirs to do the service of jehovah. and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and offer thou the one for a sinoffering and the other for a burntoffering unto jehovah to make atonement for the levites.  and thou shalt set the

after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for a waveoffering. for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of all that openeth the womb even the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me. for all the first born among the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote all the first born in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself. and i have taken the levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of israel. and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.  thus did moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel unto the

before his sons as jehovah had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them. and jehovah spake unto moses saying this is that which belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work and shall serve no more but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting to keep the charge and shall do no service. thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charges.  and jehovah spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying moreover let the children of israel keep the passover in its appointed season. in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in its appointed season according to all the statutes of it and according to all the ordinances thereof shall ye keep it. and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover. and they kept the passover in the first [month] on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that jehovah commanded moses so did the children of israel. and there were certain men who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man so that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day and those men said unto him we are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer the oblation of jehovah in its appointed season among the children of israel  and moses said unto them stay ye that i may hear what jehovah will command concerning you. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be on a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto jehovah. in the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break a bone thereof according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. but the man that is clean and is not on a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover that soul shall be cut off from his people because he offered not the oblation of jehovah in its appointed season that man shall bear his sin. and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto jehovah according to the statute of the passover and according to the ordinance thereof so shall he do ye shall have one statute both for the sojourner and for him that is born in the land.  and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle even the tent of the testimony and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until morning. so it was alway the cloud covered it and the appearance of fire by night. and whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel encamped. at the commandment of jehovah the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of jehovah they encamped as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. and when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of jehovah and journeyed not. and sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle then according to the commandment of jehovah they remained encamped and according to the commandment of jehovah they journeyed.  and sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they journeyed or [if it continued] by day and by night when the cloud was taken up they journeyed. whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle abiding thereon the children of israel remained encamped and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed. at the commandment of jehovah they encamped and at the commandment of jehovah they journeyed they kept the charge of jehovah at the commandment of jehovah by moses. and jehovah spake unto moses saying make thee two trumpets of silver of beaten work shalt thou make them and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation and for the journeying of the camps. and when they shall blow them all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting. and if they blow but one then the princes the heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee.  and when ye blow an alarm the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey. and when ye blow an alarm the second time the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. but when the assembly is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm. and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow the trumpets and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations. and when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before jehovah your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies. also in the day of your gladness and in your set feasts and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peaceofferings and they shall be to you for a memorial before your god i am jehovah your god.  and it came to pass in the second year in the second month on the twentieth day of the month that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. and the children of israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai and the cloud abode in the wilderness of paran. and they first took their journey according to the commandment of jehovah by moses. and in the first [place] the standard of the camp of the children of judah set forward according to their hosts and over his host was nahshon the son of amminadab. and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was nethanel the son of zuar. and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon. and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari who bare the tabernacle set forward. and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their hosts and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur. and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was shelumiel the son of zurishaddai.  and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was eliasaph the son of deuel. and the kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and [the others] did set up the tabernacle against their coming. and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set forward according to their hosts and over his host was elishama the son of ammihud. and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur. and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni. and the standard of the camp of the children of dan which was the rearward of all the camps set forward according to their hosts and over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai. and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ochran. and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan. thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to their hosts and they set forward.  and moses said unto hobab the son of reuel the midianite moses fatherinlaw we are journeying unto the place of which jehovah said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for jehovah hath spoken good concerning israel. and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred. and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what good soever jehovah shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee. and they set forward from the mount of jehovah three days journey and the ark of the covenant of jehovah went before them three days journey to seek out a restingplace for them. and the cloud of jehovah was over them by day when they set forward from the camp. and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up o jehovah and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee.  and when it rested he said return o jehovah unto the ten thousands of the thousands of israel. and the people were as murmurers [speaking] evil in the ears of jehovah and when jehovah heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of jehovah burnt among them and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. and the people cried unto moses and moses prayed unto jehovah and the fire abated. and the name of that place was called taberah because the fire of jehovah burnt among them. and the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt for nought the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon. and the manna was like coriander seed and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.  the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it. and moses heard the people weeping throughout their families every man at the door of his tent and the anger of jehovah was kindled greatly and moses was displeased. and moses said unto jehovah wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant and wherefore have i not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived all this people have i brought them forth that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursingfather carrieth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat. i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me. and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favor in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness.  and jehovah said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tent of meeting that they may stand there with thee. and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone. and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of jehovah saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore jehovah will give you flesh and ye shall eat. ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days but a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have rejected jehovah who is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt  and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month.  shall flocks and herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them and jehovah said unto moses is jehovahs hand waxed short now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. and moses went out and told the people the words of jehovah and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tent. and jehovah came down in the cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied but they did so no more. but there remained two men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but had not gone out unto the tent and they prophesied in the camp.  and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp. and joshua the son of nun the minister of moses one of his chosen men answered and said my lord moses forbid them.  and moses said unto him art thou jealous for my sake would that all jehovahs people were prophets that jehovah would put his spirit upon them and moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of israel. and there went forth a wind from jehovah and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp about a days journey on this side and a days journey on the other side round about the camp and about two cubits above the face of the earth. and the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day and gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the anger of jehovah was kindled against the people and jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.  and the name of that place was called kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted. from kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto hazeroth and they abode at hazeroth. and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the cushite woman whom he had married for he had married a cushite woman. and they said hath jehovah indeed spoken only with moses hath he not spoken also with us and jehovah heard it. now the man moses was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth. and jehovah spake suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. and they three came out. and jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the door of the tent and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth. and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision i will speak with him in a dream. my servant moses is not so he is faithful in all my house  with him will i speak mouth to mouth even manifestly and not in dark speeches and the form of jehovah shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant against moses and the anger of jehovah was kindled against them and he departed. and the cloud removed from over the tent and behold miriam was leprous as [white as] snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous. and aaron said unto moses oh my lord lay not i pray thee sin upon us for that we have done foolishly and for that we have sinned. let her not i pray be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers womb. and moses cried unto jehovah saying heal her o god i beseech thee. and jehovah said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut up without the camp seven days and after that she shall be brought in again. and miriam was shut up without the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again.  and afterward the people journeyed from hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of paran. and jehovah spake unto moses saying send thou men that they may spy out the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a prince among them. and moses sent them from the wilderness of paran according to the commandment of jehovah all of them men who were heads of the children of israel. and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur. of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori. of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh. of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph. of the tribe of ephraim hoshea the son of nun. of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu. of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi. of the tribe of joseph [namely] of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi. of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli. of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael. of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi. of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi.  these are the names of the men that moses sent to spy out the land. and moses called hoshea the son of nun joshua. and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way by the south and go up into the hill country and see the land what it is and the people that dwell therein whether they are strong or weak whether they are few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it is good or bad and what cities they are that they dwell in whether in camps or in strongholds and what the land is whether it is fat or lean whether there is wood therein or not. and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land. now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. so they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob to the entrance of hamath. and they went up by the south and came unto hebron and ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were there. now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt.  and they came unto the valley of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it upon a staff between two [they brought] also of the pomegranates and of the figs. that place was called the valley of eshcol because of the cluster which the children of israel cut down from thence. and they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it. howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified [and] very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there. amalek dwelleth in the land of the south and the hittite and the jebusite and the amorite dwell in the hillcountry and the canaanite dwelleth by the sea and along by the side of the jordan.  and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it. but the men that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we. and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to spy it out is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. and there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who come of the nephilim and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight. and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night. and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would that we had died in the land of egypt or would that we had died in this wilderness and wherefore doth jehovah bring us unto this land to fall by the sword our wives and our little ones will be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt  and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt. then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel. and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh who were of them that spied out the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to spy it out is an exceeding good land. if jehovah delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it unto us a land which floweth with milk and honey. only rebel not against jehovah neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is removed from over them and jehovah is with us fear them not. but all the congregation bade stone them with stones. and the glory of jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of israel. and jehovah said unto moses how long will this people despise me and how long will they not believe in me for all the signs which i have wrought among them  i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they. and moses said unto jehovah then the egyptians will hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. they have heard that thou jehovah art in the midst of this people for thou jehovah art seen face to face and thy cloud standeth over them and thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. now if thou shalt kill this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. and now i pray thee let the power of the lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying jehovah is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness forgiving iniquity and transgression and that will by no means clear [the guilty] visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation.  pardon i pray thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness and according as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now. and jehovah said i have pardoned according to thy word but in very deed as i live and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of jehovah because all those men that have seen my glory and my signs which i wrought in egypt and in the wilderness yet have tempted me these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall any of them that despised me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it. now the amalekite and the canaanite dwell in the valley tomorrow turn ye and get you into the wilderness by the way to the red sea. and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  how long [shall i bear] with this evil congregation that murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against me. say unto them as i live saith jehovah surely as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward that have murmured against me surely ye shall not come into the land concerning which i sware that i would make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun. but your little ones that ye said should be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have rejected. but as for you your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. and your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years and shall bear your whoredoms until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness. after the number of the days in which ye spied out the land even forty days for every day a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my alienation.  i jehovah have spoken surely this will i do unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die. and the men whom moses sent to spy out the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land died by the plague before jehovah. but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land. and moses told these words unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly. and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up to the top of the mountain saying lo we are here and will go up unto the place which jehovah hath promised for we have sinned. and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of jehovah seeing it shall not prosper go not up for jehovah is not among you that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.  for there the amalekite and the canaanite are before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned back from following jehovah therefore jehovah will not be with you. but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain nevertheless the ark of the covenant of jehovah and moses departed not out of the camp. then the amalekite came down and the canaanite who dwelt in that mountain and smote them and beat them down even unto hormah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you and will make an offering by fire unto jehovah a burntoffering or a sacrifice to accomplish a vow or as a freewilloffering or in your set feasts to make a sweet savor unto jehovah of the herd or of the flock then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto jehovah a mealoffering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil  and wine for the drinkoffering the fourth part of a hin shalt thou prepare with the burntoffering or for the sacrifice for each lamb. or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a mealoffering two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil and for the drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine of a sweet savor unto jehovah. and when thou preparest a bullock for a burntoffering or for a sacrifice to accomplish a vow or for peaceofferings unto jehovah then shall he offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil and thou shalt offer for the drinkoffering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto jehovah. thus shall it be done for each bullock or for each ram or for each of the he lambs or of the kids. according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to every one according to their number. all that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto jehovah.  and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto jehovah as ye do so he shall do. for the assembly there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger that sojourneth [with you] a statute for ever throughout your generations as ye are so shall the sojourner be before jehovah. one law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall offer up a heave offering unto jehovah. of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave offering as the heaveoffering of the threshing floor so shall ye heave it. of the first of your dough ye shall give unto jehovah a heaveoffering throughout your generations. and when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments which jehovah hath spoken unto moses  even all that jehovah hath commanded you by moses from the day that jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations then it shall be if it be done unwittingly without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burntoffering for a sweet savor unto jehovah with the meal offering thereof and the drink offering thereof according to the ordinance and one hegoat for a sinoffering. and the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and they shall be forgiven for it was an error and they have brought their oblation an offering made by fire unto jehovah and their sinoffering before jehovah for their error and all the congregation of the children of israel shall be forgiven and the stranger that sojourneth among them for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly. and if one person sin unwittingly then he shall offer a shegoat a year old for a sin offering. and the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth when he sinneth unwittingly before jehovah to make atonement for him and he shall be forgiven.  ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly for him that is home born among the children of israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. but the soul that doeth aught with a high hand whether he be homeborn or a sojourner the same blasphemeth jehovah and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. because he hath despised the word of jehovah and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him. and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation. and they put him in ward because it had not been declared what should be done to him. and jehovah said unto moses the man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him to death with stones as jehovah commanded moses.  and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of jehovah and do them and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to play the harlot  that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god. i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am jehovah your god. now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi with dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took [men] and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation called to the assembly men of renown  and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and jehovah is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of jehovah and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying in the morning jehovah will show who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.  this do take you censers korah and all his company and put fire in them and put incense upon them before jehovah to morrow and it shall be that the man whom jehovah doth choose he [shall be] holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi. and moses said unto korah hear now ye sons of levi  [seemeth it but] a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of jehovah and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them and that he hath brought thee near and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against jehovah and aaron what is he that ye murmur against him and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said we will not come up is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up.  and moses was very wroth and said unto jehovah respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them.  and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before jehovah thou and they and aaron to morrow and take ye every man his censer and put incense upon them and bring ye before jehovah every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each his censer. and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with moses and aaron. and korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting and the glory of jehovah appeared unto all the congregation. and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment. and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram. and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him.  and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins. so they gat them up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little ones. and moses said hereby ye shall know that jehovah hath sent me to do all these works for [i have] not [done them] of mine own mind. if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then jehovah hath not sent me. but if jehovah make a new thing and the ground open its mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down alive into sheol then ye shall understand that these men have despised jehovah. and it came to pass as he made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up and their households and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods.  so they and all that appertained to them went down alive into sheol and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the assembly. and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up. and fire came forth from jehovah and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are holy even the censers of these sinners against their own lives and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before jehovah therefore they are holy and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel. and eleazar the priest took the brazen censers which they that were burnt had offered and they beat them out for a covering of the altar to be a memorial unto the children of israel to the end that no stranger that is not of the seed of aaron come near to burn incense before jehovah that he be not as korah and as his company as jehovah spake unto him by moses.  but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of jehovah. and it came to pass when the congregation was assembled against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tent of meeting and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of jehovah appeared. and moses and aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. and jehovah spake unto moses saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment. and they fell upon their faces. and moses said unto aaron take they censer and put fire therein from off the altar and lay incense thereon and carry it quickly unto the congregation and make atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from jehovah the plague is begun. and aaron took as moses spake and ran into the midst of the assembly and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people. and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed.  now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred besides them that died about the matter of korah. and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tent of meeting and the plague was stayed. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take of them rods one for each fathers house of all their princes according to their fathers houses twelve rods write thou every mans name upon his rod. and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers houses. and thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony where i meet with you. and it shall come to pass that the rod of the man whom i shall choose shall bud and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against you. and moses spake unto the children of israel and all their princes gave him rods for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods. and moses laid up the rods before jehovah in the tent of the testimony.  and it came to pass on the morrow that moses went into the tent of the testimony and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and put forth buds and produced blossoms and bare ripe almonds. and moses brought out all the rods from before jehovah unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod. and jehovah said unto moses put back the rod of aaron before the testimony to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me that they die not. thus did moses as jehovah commanded him so did he. and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we perish we are undone we are all undone. every one that cometh near that cometh near unto the tabernacle of jehovah dieth shall we perish all of us and jehovah said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.  and thy brethren also the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou near with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony. and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tent only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar that they die not neither they nor ye. and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be wrath no more upon the children of israel. and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are a gift given unto jehovah to do the service of the tent of meeting. and thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar and for that within the veil and ye shall serve i give you the priesthood as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.  and jehovah spake unto aaron and i behold i have given thee the charge of my heaveofferings even all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons as a portion for ever. this shall be thine of the most holy things [reserved] from the fire every oblation of theirs even every meal offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespassoffering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. as the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof every male shall eat thereof it shall be holy unto thee. and this is thine the heave offering of their gift even all the waveofferings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee as a portion for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. all the best of the oil and all the best of the vintage and of the grain the firstfruits of them which they give unto jehovah to thee have i given them. the firstripe fruits of all that is in their land which they bring unto jehovah shall be thine every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.  everything devoted in israel shall be thine. everything that openeth the womb of all flesh which they offer unto jehovah both of man and beast shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. and those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary the same is twenty gerahs. but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savor unto jehovah. and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wavebreast and as the right thigh it shall be thine. all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto jehovah have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee as a portion for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.  and jehovah said unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any portion among them i am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of israel. and unto the children of levi behold i have given all the tithe in israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they serve even the service of the tent of meeting. and henceforth the children of israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting lest they bear sin and die. but the levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations and among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance. for the tithe of the children of israel which they offer as a heave offering unto jehovah i have given to the levites for an inheritance therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  moreover thou shalt speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up a heaveoffering of it for jehovah a tithe of the tithe. and your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and as the fulness of the winepress. thus ye also shall offer a heaveoffering unto jehovah of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and thereof ye shall give jehovahs heaveoffering to aaron the priest. out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of jehovah of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it. therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye heave the best thereof from it then it shall be reckoned unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress. and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best thereof and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel that ye die not.  and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron saying this is the statute of the law which jehovah hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish [and] upon which never came yoke. and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest and he shall bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even. and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even.  and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water for impurity it is a sinoffering. and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever. he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean. whosoever toucheth a dead person the body of a man that hath died and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of jehovah and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him. this is the law when a man dieth in a tent every one that cometh into the tent and every one that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.  and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean. and whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days. and for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sinoffering and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched the bone or the slain or the dead or the grave and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify him and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even. but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he hath defiled the sanctuary of jehovah the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean.  and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even. and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. and the children of israel even the whole congregation came into the wilderness of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there. and there was no water for the congregation and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron. and the people strove with moses and spake saying would that we had died when our brethren died before jehovah and why have ye brought the assembly of jehovah into this wilderness that we should die there we and our beasts and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink.  and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting and fell upon their faces and the glory of jehovah appeared unto them. and jehovah spake unto moses saying take the rod and assemble the congregation thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes that it give forth its water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink. and moses took the rod from before jehovah as he commanded him. and moses and aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels shall we bring you forth water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and smote the rock with his rod twice and water came forth abundantly and the congregation drank and their cattle. and jehovah said unto moses and aaron because ye believed not in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which i have given them.  these are the waters of meribah because the children of israel strove with jehovah and he was sanctified in them. and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us how our fathers went down into egypt and we dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians dealt ill with us and our fathers and when we cried unto jehovah he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border. let us pass i pray thee through thy land we will not pass through field or through vineyard neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go along the kings highway we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy border. and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass through me lest i come out with the sword against thee. and the children of israel said unto him we will go up by the highway and if we drink of thy water i and my cattle then will i give the price thereof let me only without [doing] anything [else] pass through on my feet.  and he said thou shalt not pass through. and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand. thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him. and they journeyed from kadesh and the children of israel even the whole congregation came unto mount hor. and jehovah spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the border of the land of edom saying aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of meribah. take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered [unto his people] and shall die there. and moses did as jehovah commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation. and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there on the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount.  and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they wept for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel. and the canaanite the king of arad who dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of atharim and he fought against israel and took some of them captive. and israel vowed a vow unto jehovah and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities. and jehovah hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and the name of the place was called hormah. and they journeyed from mount hor by the way to the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread and there is no water and our soul loatheth this light bread. and jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died.  and the people came to moses and said we have sinned because we have spoken against jehovah and against thee pray unto jehovah that he take away the serpents from us. and moses prayed for the people. and jehovah said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a standard and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he seeth it shall live. and moses made a serpent of brass and set it upon the standard and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he looked unto the serpent of brass he lived. and the children of israel journeyed and encamped in oboth. and they journeyed from oboth and encamped at iyeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising. from thence they journeyed and encamped in the valley of zered. from thence they journeyed and encamped on the other side of the arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the amorites for the arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites. wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of jehovah vaheb in suphah and the valleys of the arnon  and the slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the dwelling of ar and leaneth upon the border of moab. and from thence [they journeyed] to beer that is the well whereof jehovah said unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water. then sang israel this song spring up o well sing ye unto it the well which the princes digged which the nobles of the people delved with the sceptre [and] with their staves. and from the wilderness [they journeyed] to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth to the valley that is in the field of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh down upon the desert. and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying let me pass through thy land we will not turn aside into field or into vineyard we will not drink of the water of the wells we will go by the kings highway until we have passed thy border. and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and came to jahaz and he fought against israel.  and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from the arnon unto the jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong. and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the towns thereof. for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto the arnon. wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come ye to heshbon let the city of sihon be built and established for a fire is gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath devoured ar of moab the lords of the high places of the arnon. woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites. we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid waste even unto nophah which [reacheth] unto medeba. thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites.  and moses sent to spy out jazer and they took the towns thereof and drove out the amorites that were there. and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to battle at edrei. and jehovah said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon. so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him remaining and they possessed his land. and the children of israel journeyed and encamped in the plains of moab beyond the jordan at jericho. and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites. and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel. and moab said unto the elders of midian now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. and balak the son of zippor was king of moab at that time.  and he sent messengers unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river to the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me. come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i know that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed. and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak. and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as jehovah shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam. and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me [saying]  behold the people that is come out of egypt it covereth the face of the earth now come curse me them peradventure i shall be able to fight against them and shall drive them out. and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed. and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you. and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us. and balak sent yet again princes more and more honorable than they. and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for i will promote thee unto very great honor and whatsoever thou sayest unto me i will do come therefore i pray thee curse me this people. and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of jehovah my god to do less or more.  now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what jehovah will speak unto me more. and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men are come to call thee rise up go with them but only the word which i speak unto thee that shalt thou do. and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab. and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him. and the ass saw the angel of jehovah standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way. then the angel of jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side. and the ass saw the angel of jehovah and she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and he smote her again. and the angel of jehovah went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  and the ass saw the angel of jehovah and she lay down under balaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with his staff. and jehovah opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in my hand for now i had killed thee. and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay. then jehovah opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of jehovah standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed his head and fell on his face. and the angel of jehovah said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i am come forth for an adversary because thy way is perverse before me and the ass saw me and turned aside before me these three times unless she had turned aside from me surely now i had even slain thee and saved her alive.  and balaam said unto the angel of jehovah i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again. and the angel of jehovah said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak. so balaam went with the princes of balak. and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto the city of moab which is on the border of the arnon which is in the utmost part of the border. and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honor and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to speak anything the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak. and balaam went with balak and they came unto kiriathhuzoth. and balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him.  and it came to pass in the morning that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people. and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure jehovah will come to meet me and whatsoever he showeth me i will tell thee. and he went to a bare height. and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared the seven altars and i have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. and jehovah put a word in balaams mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak. and he returned unto him and lo he was standing by his burnt offering he and all the princes of moab. and he took up his parable and said from aram hath balak brought me the king of moab from the mountains of the east come curse me jacob and come defy israel.  how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed and how shall i defy whom jehovah hath not defied for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo it is a people that dwelleth alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations. who can count the dust of jacob or number the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether. and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which jehovah putteth in my mouth and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence. and he took him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet [jehovah] yonder. and jehovah met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said return unto balak and thus shalt thou speak.  and he came to him and lo he was standing by his burntoffering and the princes of moab with him. and balak said unto him what hath jehovah spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and will he not do it or hath he spoken and will he not make it good behold i have received [commandment] to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it. he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel jehovah his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them. god bringeth them forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of the wildox. surely there is no enchantment with jacob neither is there any divination with israel now shalt it be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought behold the people riseth up as a lioness and as a lion doth he lift himself up he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain. and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all.  but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that jehovah speaketh that i must do and balak said unto balaam come now i will take thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence. and balak took balaam unto the top of peor that looketh down upon the desert. and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. and balak did as balaam had said and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. and when balaam saw that it pleased jehovah to bless israel he went not as at the other times to meet with enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness. and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel dwelling according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him. and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor saith and the man whose eye was closed saith he saith who heareth the words of god who seeth the vision of the almighty falling down and having his eyes open how goodly are thy tents o jacob thy tabernacles o israel  as valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the riverside as lignaloes which jehovah hath planted as cedartrees beside the waters. water shall flow from his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted. god bringeth him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of the wildox he shall eat up the nations his adversaries and shall break their bones in pieces and smite [them] through with his arrows. he couched he lay down as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up blessed be every one that blesseth thee and cursed be every one that curseth thee. and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honor but lo jehovah hath kept thee back from honor. and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me saying  if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of jehovah to do either good or bad of mine own mind what jehovah speaketh that will i speak and now behold i go unto my people come [and] i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor saith and the man whose eye was closed saith he saith who heareth the words of god and knoweth the knowledge of the most high who seeth the vision of the almighty falling down and having his eyes open i see him but not now i behold him but not nigh there shall come forth a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite through the corners of moab and break down all the sons of tumult. and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession [who were] his enemies while israel doeth valiantly. and out of jacob shall one have dominion and shall destroy the remnant from the city. and he looked on amalek and took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall come to destruction.  and he looked on the kenite and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwelling place and thy nest is set in the rock. nevertheless kain shall be wasted until asshur shall carry thee away captive. and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when god doeth this but ships [shall come] from the coast of kittim and they shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall come to destruction. and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way. and israel abode in shittim and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of moab for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods. and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel. and jehovah said unto moses take all the chiefs of the people and hang them up unto jehovah before the sun that the fierce anger of jehovah may turn away from israel. and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto baalpeor.  and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting. and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand and he went after the man of israel into the pavilion and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her body. so the plague was stayed from the children of israel. and those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand. and jehovah spake unto moses saying phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them so that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy.  wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace and it shall be unto him and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was jealous for his god and made atonement for the children of israel.  now the name of the man of israel that was slain who was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a fathers house among the simeonites. and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head of the people of a fathers house in midian. and jehovah spake unto moses saying vex the midianites and smite them for they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of the prince of midian their sister who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of peor. and it came to pass after the plague that jehovah spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying take the sum of all the congregation of the children of

had no sons. why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family because he had no son give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father. and moses brought their cause before jehovah. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  the daughters of zelophehad speak right thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their fathers brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. and if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. and if he have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his fathers brethren. and if his father have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family and he shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of israel a statute [and] ordinance as

shalt be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered  because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of zin in the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. these are the waters of meribah of kadesh in the wilderness of zin. and moses spake unto jehovah saying let jehovah the god of the spirits of all flesh appoint a man over the congregation who may go out before them and who may come in before them and who may lead them out and who may bring them in that the congregation of jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd. and jehovah said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thy hand upon him and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight. and thou shalt put of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may obey. and he shall stand before eleazar the priest who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the urim before jehovah at his word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in both he and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation.  and moses did as jehovah commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as jehovah spake by moses. and jehovah spake unto moses saying command the children of israel and say unto them my oblation my food for my offerings made by fire of a sweet savor unto me shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. and

of israel according to all that jehovah commanded moses. and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of israel saying this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded. when a man voweth a vow unto jehovah or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. also when a woman voweth a vow unto jehovah and bindeth herself by a bond being in her fathers house in her youth  and her father heareth her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father holdeth his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.  but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth none of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and jehovah will forgive her because her father disallowed her. and if she be [married] to a husband while her vows are upon her or the rash utterance of her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul and her husband hear it and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. but if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it then he shall make void her vow which is upon her and the rash utterance of her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul and jehovah will forgive her. but the vow of a widow or of her that is divorced [even] everything wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand against her.  and if she vowed in her husbands house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. but if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and jehovah will forgive her.  every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void. but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he hath established them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. but if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity. these are the statutes which jehovah commanded moses between a man and his wife between a father and his daughter being in her youth in her fathers house.  and jehovah spake unto moses saying avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. and moses spake unto the people saying arm ye men from among you for the war that they may go against midian to execute jehovahs vengeance on midian. of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war. so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war. and moses sent them a thousand of every tribe to the war them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. and they warred against midian as jehovah commanded moses and they slew every male. and they slew the kings of midian with the rest of their slain evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba the five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword. and the children of israel took captive the women of midian and their little ones and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they took for a prey.  and all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt and all their encampments they burnt with fire. and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of man and of beast. and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and unto eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by the jordan at jericho. and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp. and moses was wroth with the officers of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who came from the service of the war. and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against jehovah in the matter of peor and so the plague was among the congregation of jehovah. now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  but all the womenchildren that have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves. and encamp ye without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day ye and your captives. and as to every garment and all that is made of skin and all work of goats [hair] and all things made of wood ye shall purify yourselves. and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle this is the statute of the law which jehovah hath commanded moses howbeit the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead everything that may abide the fire ye shall make to go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water. and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp. and jehovah spake unto moses saying  take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers [houses] of the congregation and divide the prey into two parts between the men skilled in war that went out to battle and all the congregation. and levy a tribute unto jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle one soul of five hundred [both] of the persons and of the oxen and of the asses and of the flocks take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for jehovahs heave offering. and of the children of israels half thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons of the oxen of the asses and of the flocks [even] of all the cattle and give them unto the levites that keep the charge of the tabernacle of jehovah. and moses and eleazar the priest did as jehovah commanded moses. now the prey over and above the booty which the men of war took was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep and threescore and twelve thousand oxen and threescore and one thousand asses  and thirty and two thousand persons in all of the women that had not known man by lying with him. and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and jehovahs tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. and the oxen were thirty and six thousand of which jehovahs tribute was threescore and twelve. and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which jehovahs tribute was threescore and one. and the persons were sixteen thousand of whom jehovahs tribute was thirty and two persons. and moses gave the tribute which was jehovahs heaveoffering unto eleazar the priest as jehovah commanded moses. and of the children of israels half which moses divided off from the men that warred now the congregations half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand seven thousand and five hundred sheep and thirty and six thousand oxen and thirty thousand and five hundred asses  and sixteen thousand persons even of the children of israels half moses took one drawn out of every fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites that kept the charge of the tabernacle of jehovah as jehovah commanded moses. and the officers that were over the thousands of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds came near unto moses and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us. and we have brought jehovahs oblation what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold ankle chains and bracelets signet rings earrings and armlets to make atonement for our souls before jehovah. and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels. and all the gold of the heave offering that they offered up to jehovah of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. [for] the men of war had taken booty every man for himself.  and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting for a memorial for the children of israel before jehovah. now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and sebam and nebo and beon the land which jehovah smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle. and they said if we have found favor in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession bring us not over the jordan. and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to the war and shall ye sit here and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which jehovah hath given them  thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land. for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which jehovah had given them. and jehovahs anger was kindled in that day and he sware saying surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have wholly followed jehovah. and jehovahs anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of jehovah was consumed. and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of jehovah toward israel. for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye will destroy all this people.  and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance. for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the jordan and forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the jordan eastward. and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will arm yourselves to go before jehovah to the war and every armed man of you will pass over the jordan before jehovah until he hath driven out his enemies from before him and the land is subdued before jehovah then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless towards jehovah and towards israel and this land shall be unto you for a possession before jehovah. but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against jehovah and be sure your sin will find you out.  build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead but thy servants will pass over every man that is armed for war before jehovah to battle as my lord saith. so moses gave charge concerning them to eleazar the priest and to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of the fathers [houses] of the tribes of the children of israel. and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over the jordan every man that is armed to battle before jehovah and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan. and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as jehovah hath said unto thy servants so will we do.  we will pass over armed before jehovah into the land of canaan and the possession of our inheritance [shall

moab by the jordan at jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye pass over the jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their figured [stones] and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places and ye shall take possession of the land and dwell therein for unto you have i given the land to possess it.  and ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance wheresoever the lot falleth to any man that shall be his according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.  but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. and it shall come to pass that as i thought to do unto them so will i do unto you. and jehovah spake unto moses saying command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan according to the borders thereof then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the side of edom and your south border shall be from the end of the salt sea eastward  and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of akrabbim and pass along to zin and the goings out thereof shall be southward of kadeshbarnea and it shall go forth to hazar addar and pass along to azmon and the border shall turn about from azmon unto the brook of egypt and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea. and for the western border ye shall have the great sea and the border [thereof] this shall be your west border.  and this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount hor from mount hor ye shall mark out unto

the sea of chinnereth eastward  and the border shall go down to the jordan and the goings out thereof shall be at the salt sea. this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about. and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the halftribe for the tribe of the children of reuben according to their fathers houses and the tribe of the children of gad according to their fathers houses have received and the halftribe of manasseh have received their inheritance  the two tribes and the halftribe have received their inheritance beyond the jordan at jericho eastward toward the sunrising. and jehovah spake unto moses saying these are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun. and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land for inheritance. and these are the names of the men of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh. and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud.  of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon. and of the tribe of the children of dan a prince bukki the son of jogli. of the children of joseph of the tribe of the children of manasseh a prince hanniel the son of ephod. and of the tribe of the children of ephraim a prince kemuel the son of shiphtan. and of the tribe of the children of zebulun a prince elizaphan the son of parnach. and of the tribe of the children of issachar a prince paltiel the son of azzan. and of the tribe of the children of asher a prince ahihud the son of shelomi. and of the tribe of the children of naphtali a prince pedahel the son of ammihud. these are they whom jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan. and jehovah spake unto moses in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho saying command the children of israel that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the levites. and the cities shall they have to dwell in and their suburbs shall be for their cattle and for their substance and for all their beasts.  and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the levites shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. and ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits and for the south side two thousand cubits and for the west side two thousand cubits and for the north side two thousand cubits the city being in the midst. this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. and the cities which ye shall give unto the levites they shall be the six cities of refuge which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities. all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them [shall ye give] with their suburbs. and concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of israel from the many ye shall take many and from the few ye shall take few every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the levites. and jehovah spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye pass over the jordan into the land of canaan  then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. and the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation for judgment. and the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. ye shall give three cities beyond the jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan they shall be cities of refuge. for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them shall these six cities be for refuge that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. but if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death. and if he smote him with a stone in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death. or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death.  the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death when he meeteth him he shall put him to death. and if he thrust him of hatred or hurled at him lying in wait so that he died or in enmity smote him with his hand so that he died he that smote him shall surely be put to death he is a murderer the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meeteth him. but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait or with any stone whereby a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him so that he died and he was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge whither he was fled and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil. but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge whither he fleeth  and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession. and these things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die. moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer that is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death. and ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge that he may come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest. so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it polluteth the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it.  and thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit in the midst of which i dwell for i jehovah dwell in the midst of the children of israel. and the heads of the fathers [houses] of the family of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the heads of the fathers [houses] of the children of israel and they said jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by jehovah to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. and if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of israel then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.  and when the jubilee of the children of israel shall be then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of jehovah saying the tribe of the sons of joseph speaketh right. this is the thing which jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them be married to whom they think best only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. so shall no inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for the children of israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe for the tribes of the children of israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.  even as jehovah commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their fathers brothers sons. they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. these are the commandments and the ordinances which jehovah commanded by moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho. these are the words which moses spake unto all israel beyond the jordan in the wilderness in the arabah over against suph between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and di zahab. it is eleven days [journey] from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadesh barnea. and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses spake unto the children of israel according unto all that jehovah had given him in commandment unto them  after he had smitten sihon the king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan who dwelt in ashtaroth at edrei. beyond the jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying jehovah our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain turn you and take your journey and go to the hill country of the amorites and unto all [the places] nigh thereunto in the arabah in the hillcountry and in the lowland and in the south and by the sea shore the land of the canaanites and lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates. behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which jehovah sware unto your fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them. and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone jehovah your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. jehovah the god of your fathers make you a thousand times as many as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you  how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife take you wise men and understanding and known according to your tribes and i will make them heads over you. and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do. so i took the heads of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and officers according to your tribes. and i charged your judges at that time saying hear [the causes] between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother and the sojourner that is with him. ye shall not respect persons in judgment ye shall hear the small and the great alike ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me and i will hear it. and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.  and we journeyed from horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way to the hill country of the amorites as jehovah our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea. and i said unto you ye are come unto the hill country of the amorites which jehovah our god giveth unto us. behold jehovah thy god hath set the land before thee go up take possession as jehovah the god of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee fear not neither be dismayed. and ye came near unto me every one of you and said let us send men before us that they may search the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities unto which we shall come. and the thing pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one man for every tribe and they turned and went up into the hillcountry and came unto the valley of eshcol and spied it out. and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which jehovah our god giveth unto us.  yet ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of jehovah your god and ye murmured in your tents and said because jehovah hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us. whither are we going up our brethren have made our heart to melt saying the people are greater and taller than we the cities are great and fortified up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakim there. then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them. jehovah your god who goeth before you he will fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that jehovah thy god bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came unto this place. yet in this thing ye did not believe jehovah your god who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to show you by what way ye should go and in the cloud by day. and jehovah heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware saying  surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land which i sware to give unto your fathers save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed jehovah. also jehovah was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also shalt not go in thither joshua the son of nun who standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage thou him for he shall cause israel to inherit it. moreover your little ones that ye said should be a prey and your children that this day have no knowledge of good or evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it. but as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the red sea. then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against jehovah we will go up and fight according to all that jehovah our god commanded us. and ye girded on every man his weapons of war and were forward to go up into the hillcountry.  and jehovah said unto me say unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies. so i spake unto you and ye hearkened not but ye rebelled against the commandment of jehovah and were presumptuous and went up into the hillcountry. and the amorites that dwelt in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in seir even unto hormah. and ye returned and wept before jehovah but jehovah hearkened not to your voice nor gave ear unto you. so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode [there]. then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the red sea as jehovah spake unto me and we compassed mount seir many days. and jehovah spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward. and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of esau that dwell in seir and they will be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore  contend not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession. ye shall purchase food of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drink. for jehovah thy god hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years jehovah thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothing. so we passed by from our brethren the children of esau that dwell in seir from the way of the arabah from elath and from eziongeber. and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab. and jehovah said unto me vex not moab neither contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of his land for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession. the emim dwelt therein aforetime a people great and many and tall as the anakim these also are accounted rephaim as the anakim but the moabites call them emim.  the horites also dwelt in seir aforetime but the children of esau succeeded them and they destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his possession which jehovah gave unto them. now rise up and get you over the brook zered. and we went over the brook zered. and the days in which we came from kadesh barnea until we were come over the brook zered were thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp as jehovah sware unto them. moreover the hand of jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed. so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people that jehovah spake unto me saying thou art this day to pass over ar the border of moab and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon vex them not nor contend with them for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon for a possession because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession.  that also is accounted a land of rephaim rephaim dwelt therein aforetime but the ammonites call them zamzummim a people great and many and tall as the anakim but jehovah destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead as he did for the children of esau that dwell in seir when he destroyed the horites from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day and the avvim that dwelt in villages as far as gaza the caphtorim that came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead. rise ye up take your journey and pass over the valley of the arnon behold i have given into thy hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle.  this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven who shall hear the report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee. and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying  let me pass through thy land i will go along by the highway i will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left. thou shalt sell me food for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only let me pass through on my feet as the children of esau that dwell in seir and the moabites that dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over the jordan into the land which jehovah our god giveth us. but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for jehovah thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as at this day. and jehovah said unto me behold i have begun to deliver up sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land.  then sihon came out against us he and all his people unto battle at jahaz. and jehovah our god delivered him up before us and we smote him and his sons and all his people. and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every inhabited city with the women and the little ones we left none remaining only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.  from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and [from] the city that is in the valley even unto gilead there was not a city too high for us jehovah our god delivered up all before us only to the land of the children of ammon thou camest not near all the side of the river jabbok and the cities of the hillcountry and wheresoever jehovah our god forbade us. then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us he and all his people unto battle at edrei. and jehovah said unto me fear him not for i have delivered him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon. so jehovah our god delivered into our hand og also the king of bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.  and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of argob the kingdom of og in bashan. all these were cities fortified with high walls gates and bars besides the unwalled towns a great many.  and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of heshbon utterly destroying every inhabited city with the women and the little ones. but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey unto ourselves. and we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites that were beyond the jordan from the valley of the arnon unto mount hermon [which] hermon the sidonians call sirion and the amorites call it senir all the cities of the plain and all gilead and all bashan unto salecah and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan. for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of the rephaim behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbah of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man. and this land we took in possession at that time from aroer which is by the valley of the arnon and half the hillcountry of gilead and the cities thereof gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites  and the rest of gilead and all bashan the kingdom of og gave i unto the halftribe of manasseh all the region of argob even all bashan. the same is called the land of rephaim. jair the son of manasseh took all the region of argob unto the border of the geshurites and the maacathites and called them even bashan after his own name havvoth jair unto this day. and i gave gilead unto machir. and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the valley of the arnon the middle of the valley and the border [thereof] even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon the arabah also and the jordan and the border [thereof] from chinnereth even unto the sea of the arabah the salt sea under the slopes of pisgah eastward. and i commanded you at that time saying jehovah your god hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel all the men of valor. but your wives and your little ones and your cattle i know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i have given you  until jehovah give rest unto your brethren as unto you and they also possess the land which jehovah your god giveth them beyond the jordan then shall ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you. and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that jehovah your god hath done unto these two kings so shall jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. ye shall not fear them for jehovah your god he it is that fighteth for you. and i besought jehovah at that time saying o lord jehovah thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy strong hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy mighty acts let me go over i pray thee and see the good land that is beyond the jordan that goodly mountain and lebanon. but jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes and hearkened not unto me and jehovah said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matter.  get thee up unto the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan. but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. so we abode in the valley over against beth peor. and now o israel hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances which i teach you to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which jehovah the god of your fathers giveth you. ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish from it that ye may keep the commandments of jehovah your god which i command you. your eyes have seen what jehovah did because of baal peor for all the men that followed baalpeor jehovah thy god hath destroyed them from the midst of thee. but ye that did cleave unto jehovah your god are alive every one of you this day.  behold i have taught you statutes and ordinances even as jehovah my god commanded me that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it. keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples that shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. for what great nation is there that hath a god so nigh unto them as jehovah our god is whensoever we call upon him and what great nation is there that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but make them known unto thy children and thy childrens children the day that thou stoodest before jehovah thy god in horeb when jehovah said unto me assemble me the people and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth and that they may teach their children.  and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven with darkness cloud and thick darkness. and jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of words but ye saw no form only [ye heard] a voice. and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even the ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. and jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of form on the day that jehovah spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire. lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image in the form of any figure the likeness of male or female the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth  and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven thou be drawn away and worship them and serve them which jehovah thy god hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven. but jehovah hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace out of egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as at this day. furthermore jehovah was angry with me for your sakes and sware that i should not go over the jordan and that i should not go in unto that good land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance but i must die in this land i must not go over the jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good land. take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of jehovah your god which he made with you and make you a graven image in the form of anything which jehovah thy god hath forbidden thee. for jehovah thy god is a devouring fire a jealous god.  when thou shalt beget children and childrens children and ye shall have been long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image in the form of anything and shall do that which is evil in the sight of jehovah thy god to provoke him to anger i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed. and jehovah will scatter you among the peoples and ye shall be left few in number among the nations whither jehovah shall lead you away. and there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. but from thence ye shall seek jehovah thy god and thou shalt find him when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee in the latter days thou shalt return to jehovah thy god and hearken unto his voice for jehovah thy god is a merciful god he will not fail thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.  for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that god created man upon the earth and from the one end of heaven unto the other whether there hath been [any such thing] as this great thing is or hath been heard like it did ever a people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and live or hath god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation by trials by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors according to all that jehovah your god did for you in egypt before your eyes unto thee it was showed that thou mightest know that jehovah he is god there is none else besides him. out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out with his presence with his great power out of egypt  to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as at this day. know therefore this day and lay it to thy heart that jehovah he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else. and thou shalt keep his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for ever. then moses set apart three cities beyond the jordan toward the sunrising that the manslayer might flee thither that slayeth his neighbor unawares and hated him not in time past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live [namely] bezer in the wilderness in the plain country for the reubenites and ramoth in gilead for the gadites and golan in bashan for the manassites. and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which moses spake unto the children of israel when they came forth out of egypt  beyond the jordan in the valley over against beth peor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses and the children of israel smote when they came forth out of egypt. and they took his land in possession and the land of og king of bashan the two kings of the amorites who were beyond the jordan toward the sunrising from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon even unto mount sion the same is hermon and all the arabah beyond the jordan eastward even unto the sea of the arabah under the slopes of pisgah. and moses called unto all israel and said unto them hear o israel the statutes and the ordinances which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and observe to do them. jehovah our god made a covenant with us in horeb. jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day. jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire  i stood between jehovah and you at that time to show you the word of jehovah for ye were afraid because of the fire and went not up into the mount saying i am jehovah thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage. thou shalt have no other gods before me. thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i jehovah thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. observe the sabbath day to keep it holy as jehovah thy god commanded thee. six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work  but the seventh day is a sabbath unto jehovah thy god [in it] thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and jehovah thy god brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm therefore jehovah thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. honor thy father and thy mother as jehovah thy god commanded thee that thy days may be long and that it may go well with thee in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee. thou shalt not kill. neither shalt thou commit adultery. neither shalt thou steal. neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor. neither shalt thou covet thy neighbors wife neither shalt thou desire thy neighbors house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or anything that is thy neighbors.  these words jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more. and he wrote them upon two tables of stone and gave them unto me. and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders and ye said behold jehovah our god hath showed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that god doth speak with man and he liveth. now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of jehovah our god any more then we shall die. for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived go thou near and hear all that jehovah our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that jehovah our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it.  and jehovah heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and jehovah said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken. oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever go say to them return ye to your tents. but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto thee all the commandment and the statutes and the ordinances which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it. ye shall observe to do therefore as jehovah your god hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. ye shall walk in all the way which jehovah your god hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.  now this is the commandment the statutes and the ordinances which jehovah your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it that thou mightest fear jehovah thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged. hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as jehovah the god of thy fathers hath promised unto thee in a land flowing with milk and honey. hear o israel jehovah our god is one jehovah and thou shalt love jehovah thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. and these words which i command thee this day shall be upon thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up. and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.  and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates. and it shall be when jehovah thy god shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not and houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and cisterns hewn out which thou hewedst not vineyards and olivetrees which thou plantedst not and thou shalt eat and be full then beware lest thou forget jehovah who brought thee forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage. thou shalt fear jehovah thy god and him shalt thou serve and shalt swear by his name. ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the peoples that are round about you for jehovah thy god in the midst of thee is a jealous god lest the anger of jehovah thy god be kindled against thee and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth. ye shall not tempt jehovah your god as ye tempted him in massah. ye shall diligently keep the commandments of jehovah your god and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee.  and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of jehovah that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which jehovah sware unto thy fathers  to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee as jehovah hath spoken. when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which jehovah our god hath commanded you then thou shalt say unto thy son we were pharaohs bondmen in egypt and jehovah brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand and jehovah showed signs and wonders great and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his house before our eyes and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. and jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes to fear jehovah our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as at this day. and it shall be righteousness unto us if we observe to do all this commandment before jehovah our god as he hath commanded us.  when jehovah thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and shall cast out many nations before thee the hittite and the girgashite and the amorite and the canaanite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite seven nations greater and mightier than thou  and when jehovah thy god shall deliver them up before thee and thou shalt smite them then thou shalt utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. for he will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of jehovah be kindled against you and he will destroy thee quickly. but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and hew down their asherim and burn their graven images with fire. for thou art a holy people unto jehovah thy god jehovah thy god hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.  jehovah did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all peoples but because jehovah loveth you and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers hath jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt.  know therefore that jehovah thy god he is god the faithful god who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face. thou shalt therefore keep the commandment and the statutes and the ordinances which i command thee this day to do them. and it shall come to pass because ye hearken to these ordinances and keep and do them that jehovah thy god will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers  and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. thou shalt be blessed above all peoples there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle. and jehovah will take away from thee all sickness and none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest will he put upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. and thou shalt consume all the peoples that jehovah thy god shall deliver unto thee thine eye shall not pity them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee. if thou shalt say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them thou shalt not be afraid of them thou shalt well remember what jehovah thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt  the great trials which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm whereby jehovah thy god brought thee out so shall jehovah thy god do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid. moreover jehovah thy god will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves perish from before thee. thou shalt not be affrighted at them for jehovah thy god is in the midst of thee a great god and a terrible. and jehovah thy god will cast out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. but jehovah thy god will deliver them up before thee and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture until they be destroyed. and he will deliver their kings into thy hand and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them.  the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to jehovah thy god. and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house and become a devoted thing like unto it thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a devoted thing. all the commandment which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which jehovah sware unto your fathers. and thou shalt remember all the way which jehovah thy god hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness that he might humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thy heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not. and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of jehovah doth man live.  thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years. and thou shalt consider in thy heart that as a man chasteneth his son so jehovah thy god chasteneth thee. and thou shalt keep the commandments of jehovah thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him. for jehovah thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and springs flowing forth in valleys and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olivetrees and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper. and thou shalt eat and be full and thou shalt bless jehovah thy god for the good land which he hath given thee. beware lest thou forget jehovah thy god in not keeping his commandments and his ordinances and his statutes which i command thee this day lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein  and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget jehovah thy god who brought thee forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness [wherein were] fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end and [lest] thou say in thy heart my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth. but thou shalt remember jehovah thy god for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as at this day. and it shall be if thou shalt forget jehovah thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.  as the nations that jehovah maketh to perish before you so shall ye perish because ye would not hearken unto the voice of jehovah your god. hear o israel thou art to pass over the jordan this day to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fortified up to heaven a people great and tall the sons of the anakim whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can stand before the sons of anak know therefore this day that jehovah thy god is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire he will destroy them and he will bring them down before thee so shalt thou drive them out and make them to perish quickly as jehovah hath spoken unto thee. speak not thou in thy heart after that jehovah thy god hath thrust them out from before thee saying for my righteousness jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land whereas for the wickedness of these nations jehovah doth drive them out from before thee.  not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go in to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations jehovah thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may establish the word which jehovah sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob. know therefore that jehovah thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people. remember forget thou not how thou provokedst jehovah thy god to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against jehovah. also in horeb ye provoked jehovah to wrath and jehovah was angry with you to destroy you. when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which jehovah made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water.  and jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them [was written] according to all the words which jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that jehovah gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant. and jehovah said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image. furthermore jehovah spake unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount was burning with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.  and i looked and behold ye had sinned against jehovah your god ye had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which jehovah had commanded you. and i took hold of the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyes. and i fell down before jehovah as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sin which ye sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger. for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. but jehovah hearkened unto me that time also. and jehovah was very angry with aaron to destroy him and i prayed for aaron also at the same time. and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. and at taberah and at massah and at kibroth hattaavah ye provoked jehovah to wrath.  and when jehovah sent you from kadesh barnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of jehovah your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice. ye have been rebellious against jehovah from the day that i knew you. so i fell down before jehovah the forty days and forty nights that i fell down because jehovah had said he would destroy you. and i prayed unto jehovah and said o lord jehovah destroy not thy people and thine inheritance that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness that thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand. remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.  yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm. at that time jehovah said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood. and i will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark. so i made an ark of acacia wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in my hand. and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and jehovah gave them unto me. and i turned and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they are as jehovah commanded me. and the children of israel journeyed from beeroth bene jaakan to moserah. there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his stead.  from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbathah a land of brooks of water. at that time jehovah set apart the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of jehovah to stand before jehovah to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day. wherefore levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren jehovah is his inheritance according as jehovah thy god spake unto him. and i stayed in the mount as at the first time forty days and forty nights and jehovah hearkened unto me that time also jehovah would not destroy thee. and jehovah said unto me arise take thy journey before the people and they shall go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them. and now israel what doth jehovah thy god require of thee but to fear jehovah thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve jehovah thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul to keep the commandments of jehovah and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good  behold unto jehovah thy god belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens the earth with all that is therein. only jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all peoples as at this day. circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked. for jehovah your god he is god of gods and lord of lords the great god the mighty and the terrible who regardeth not persons nor taketh reward. he doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow and loveth the sojourner in giving him food and raiment. love ye therefore the sojourner for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt. thou shalt fear jehovah thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and by his name shalt thou swear. he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen. thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now jehovah thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.  therefore thou shalt love jehovah thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his ordinances and his commandments alway. and know ye this day for [i speak] not with your children that have not known and that have not seen the chastisement of jehovah your god his greatness his mighty hand and his outstretched arm and his signs and his works which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came unto this place and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and every living thing that followed them in the midst of all israel but your eyes have seen all the great work of jehovah which he did.  therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which i command thee this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go over to possess it and that ye may prolong your days in the land which jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land flowing with milk and honey. for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land whither ye go over to possess it is a land of hills and valleys [and] drinketh water of the rain of heaven a land which jehovah thy god careth for the eyes of jehovah thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love jehovah your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that i will give the rain of your land in its season the former rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil.  and i will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle and thou shalt eat and be full. take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and the anger of jehovah be kindled against you and he shut up the heavens so that there shall be no rain and the land shall not yield its fruit and ye perish quickly from off the good land which jehovah giveth you. therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. and ye shall teach them your children talking of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up. and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them as the days of the heavens above the earth. for if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which i command you to do it to love jehovah your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him  then will jehovah drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the hinder sea shall be your border. there shall no man be able to stand before you jehovah your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath spoken unto you. behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of jehovah your god which i command you this day and the curse if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of jehovah your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known. and it shall come to pass when jehovah thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount ebal.  are they not beyond the jordan behind the way of the going down of the sun in the land of the canaanites that dwell in the arabah over against gilgal beside the oaks of moreh  for ye are to pass over the jordan to go in to possess the land which jehovah your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein. and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which i set before you this day. these are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which jehovah the god of thy fathers hath given thee to possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth. ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree and ye shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their asherim with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. ye shall not do so unto jehovah your god.  but unto the place which jehovah your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and thither thou shalt come and thither ye shall bring your burntofferings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and your vows and your freewillofferings and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock  and there ye shall eat before jehovah your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein jehovah thy god hath blessed thee. ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which jehovah thy god giveth thee. but when ye go over the jordan and dwell in the land which jehovah your god causeth you to inherit and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety  then it shall come to pass that to the place which jehovah your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto jehovah. and ye shall rejoice before jehovah your god ye and your sons and your daughters and your men servants and your maid servants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.  take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burntofferings in every place that thou seest but in the place which jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee. notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates after all the desire of thy soul according to the blessing of jehovah thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the gazelle and as of the hart. only ye shall not eat the blood thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.  thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain or of thy new wine or of thine oil or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill offerings nor the heaveoffering of thy hand but thou shalt eat them before jehovah thy god in the place which jehovah thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before jehovah thy god in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest in thy land. when jehovah thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul desireth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh after all the desire of thy soul. if the place which jehovah thy god shall choose to put his name there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which jehovah hath given thee as i have commanded thee and thou mayest eat within thy gates after all the desire of thy soul.  even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat thereof the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike. only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the life and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh. thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of jehovah. only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which jehovah shall choose and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon the altar of jehovah thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of jehovah thy god and thou shalt eat the flesh. observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of jehovah thy god.  when jehovah thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest in to dispossess them and thou dispossessest them and dwellest in their land take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them after that they are destroyed from before thee and that thou inquire not after their gods saying how do these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise. thou shalt not do so unto jehovah thy god for every abomination to jehovah which he hateth have they done unto their gods for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods. what thing soever i command you that shall ye observe to do thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it. if there arise in the midst of thee a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he give thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them  thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or unto that dreamer of dreams for jehovah your god proveth you to know whether ye love jehovah your god with all your heart and with all your soul. ye shall walk after jehovah your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him. and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken rebellion against jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage to draw thee aside out of the way which jehovah thy god commanded thee to walk in. so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend that is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers of the gods of the peoples that are round about you nigh unto thee or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth  thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal him but thou shalt surely kill him thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people. and thou shalt stone him to death with stones because he hath sought to draw thee away from jehovah thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage. and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee. if thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities which jehovah thy god giveth thee to dwell there saying certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which ye have not known then shalt thou inquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee  thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the sword. and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit unto jehovah thy god and it shall be a heap for ever it shall not be built again. and there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand that jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show thee mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath sworn unto thy fathers when thou shalt hearken to the voice of jehovah thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee this day to do that which is right in the eyes of jehovah thy god. ye are the children of jehovah your god ye shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. for thou art a holy people unto jehovah thy god and jehovah hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.  these are the beasts which ye may eat the ox the sheep and the goat the hart and the gazelle and the roebuck and the wild goat and the pygarg and the antelope and the chamois. and every beast that parteth the hoof and hath the hoof cloven in two [and] cheweth the cud among the beasts that may ye eat. nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that have the hoof cloven the camel and the hare and the coney because they chew the cud but part not the hoof they are unclean unto you. and the swine because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud he is unclean unto you of their flesh ye shall not eat and their carcasses ye shall not touch. these ye may eat of all that are in the waters whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat it is unclean unto you. of all clean birds ye may eat. but these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle and the giereagle and the ospray and the glede and the falcon and the kite after its kind and every raven after its kind and the ostrich and the night hawk and the seamew and the hawk after its kind  the little owl and the great owl and the horned owl and the pelican and the vulture and the cormorant and the stork and the heron after its kind and the hoopoe and the bat. and all winged creeping things are unclean unto you they shall not be eaten. of all clean birds ye may eat. ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou mayest give it unto the sojourner that is within thy gates that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner for thou art a holy people unto jehovah thy god. thou shalt not boil a kid in its mothers milk. thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed that which cometh forth from the field year by year. and thou shalt eat before jehovah thy god in the place which he shall choose to cause his name to dwell there the tithe of thy grain of thy new wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock that thou mayest learn to fear jehovah thy god always. and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it because the place is too far from thee which jehovah thy god shall choose to set his name there when jehovah thy god shall bless thee  then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up the money in thy hand and shalt go unto the place which jehovah thy god shall choose and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee and thou shalt eat there before jehovah thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou and thy household. and the levite that is within thy gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee. at the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates and the levite because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee and the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that jehovah thy god may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest. at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.  and this is the manner of the release every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother because jehovahs release hath been proclaimed. of a foreigner thou mayest exact it but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release. howbeit there shall be no poor with thee for jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god to observe to do all this commandment which i command thee this day. for jehovah thy god will bless thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt rule over many nations but they shall not rule over thee. if there be with thee a poor man one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which jehovah thy god giveth thee thou shalt not harden thy heart nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wanteth.  beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou give him nought and he cry unto jehovah against thee and it be sin unto thee. thou shalt surely give him and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing jehovah thy god will bless thee in all thy work and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. for the poor will never cease out of the land therefore i command thee saying thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother to thy needy and to thy poor in thy land. if thy brother a hebrew man or a hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. and when thou lettest him go free from thee thou shalt not let him go empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy threshingfloor and out of thy winepress as jehovah thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and jehovah thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing today.  and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go out from thee because he loveth thee and thy house because he is well with thee then thou shalt take an awl and thrust it through his ear unto the door and he shall be thy servant for ever. and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou lettest him go free from thee for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years and jehovah thy god will bless thee in all that thou doest. all the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto jehovah thy god thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd nor shear the firstling of thy flock. thou shalt eat it before jehovah thy god year by year in the place which jehovah shall choose thou and thy household. and if it have any blemish [as if it be] lame or blind any ill blemish whatsoever thou shalt not sacrifice it unto jehovah thy god. thou shalt eat it within thy gates the unclean and the clean [shall eat it] alike as the gazelle and as the hart. only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.  observe the month of abib and keep the passover unto jehovah thy god for in the month of abib jehovah thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night. and thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto jehovah thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which jehovah shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life. and there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days neither shall any of the flesh which thou sacrificest the first day at even remain all night until the morning. thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which jehovah thy god giveth thee but at the place which jehovah thy god shall choose to cause his name to dwell in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt.  and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which jehovah thy god shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents. six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to jehovah thy god thou shalt do no work [therein]. seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks. and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto jehovah thy god with a tribute of a freewilloffering of thy hand which thou shalt give according as jehovah thy god blesseth thee and thou shalt rejoice before jehovah thy god thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy man servant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow that are in the midst of thee in the place which jehovah thy god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.  thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing floor and from thy winepress and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite and the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates. seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto jehovah thy god in the place which jehovah shall choose because jehovah thy god will bless thee in all thine increase and in all the work of thy hands and thou shalt be altogether joyful. three times in a year shall all thy males appear before jehovah thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before jehovah empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of jehovah thy god which he hath given thee. judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which jehovah thy god giveth thee according to thy tribes and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.  thou shalt not wrest justice thou shalt not respect persons neither shalt thou take a bribe for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous. that which is altogether just shalt thou follow that thou mayest live and inherit the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee. thou shalt not plant thee an asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of jehovah thy god which thou shalt make thee. neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar which jehovah thy god hateth. thou shalt not sacrifice unto jehovah thy god an ox or a sheep wherein is a blemish [or] anything evil for that is an abomination unto jehovah thy god. if there be found in the midst of thee within any of thy gates which jehovah thy god giveth thee man or woman that doeth that which is evil in the sight of jehovah thy god in transgressing his covenant and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not commanded and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it then shalt thou inquire diligently and behold if it be true and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in israel  then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who hath done this evil thing unto thy gates even the man or the woman and thou shalt stone them to death with stones. at the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is to die be put to death at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. the hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterward the hand of all the people. so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment between blood and blood between plea and plea and between stroke and stroke being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise and get thee up unto the place which jehovah thy god shall choose and thou shalt come unto the priests the levites and unto the judge that shall be in those days and thou shalt inquire and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment.  and thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show thee from that place which jehovah shall choose and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee  according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show thee to the right hand nor to the left. and the man that doeth presumptuously in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before jehovah thy god or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put away the evil from israel. and all the people shall hear and fear and do no more presumptuously. when thou art come unto the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say i will set a king over me like all the nations that are round about me thou shalt surely set him king over thee whom jehovah thy god shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee who is not thy brother.  only he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he may multiply horses forasmuch as jehovah hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return no more that way.  neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of [that which is] before the priests the levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear jehovah his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel. the priests the levites [even] all the tribe of levi shall have no portion nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of jehovah made by fire and his inheritance. and they shall have no inheritance among their brethren jehovah is their inheritance as he hath spoken unto them.  and this shall be the priests due from the people from them that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw. the firstfruits of thy grain of thy new wine and of thine oil and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him. for jehovah thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of jehovah him and his sons for ever. and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel where he sojourneth and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which jehovah shall choose then he shall minister in the name of jehovah his god as all his brethren the levites do who stand there before jehovah. they shall have like portions to eat besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony. when thou art come into the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. there shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire one that useth divination one that practiseth augury or an enchanter or a sorcerer  or a charmer or a consulter with a familiar spirit or a wizard or a necromancer. for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto jehovah and because of these abominations jehovah thy god doth drive them out from before thee. thou shalt be perfect with jehovah thy god. for these nations that thou shalt dispossess hearken unto them that practise augury and unto diviners but as for thee jehovah thy god hath not suffered thee so to do. jehovah thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken according to all that thou desiredst of jehovah thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of jehovah my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not. and jehovah said unto me they have well said that which they have spoken. i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and i will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him.  and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him. but the prophet that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods that same prophet shall die. and if thou say in thy heart how shall we know the word which jehovah hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of jehovah if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which jehovah hath not spoken the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him. when jehovah thy god shall cut off the nations whose land jehovah thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it. thou shalt prepare thee the way and divide the borders of thy land which jehovah thy god causeth thee to inherit into three parts that every manslayer may flee thither.  and this is the case of the manslayer that shall flee thither and live whoso killeth his neighbor unawares and hated him not in time past as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbor so that he dieth he shall flee unto one of these cities and live lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and smite him mortally whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt set apart three cities for thee. and if jehovah thy god enlarge thy border as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it which i command thee this day to love jehovah thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee besides these three  that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon thee. but if any man hate his neighbor and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally so that he dieth and he flee into one of these cities then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die. thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee. thou shalt not remove thy neighbors landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it. one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established. if an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong doing then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before jehovah before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days  and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and have testified falsely against his brother then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to do unto his brother so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. and those that remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. and thine eyes shall not pity life [shall go] for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot. when thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots [and] a people more than thou thou shalt not be afraid of them for jehovah thy god is with thee who brought thee up out of the land of egypt. and it shall be when ye draw nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them hear o israel ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies let not your heart faint fear not nor tremble neither be ye affrighted at them for jehovah your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you.  and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. and what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and hath not used the fruit thereof let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man use the fruit thereof. and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her. and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart melt as his heart. and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people. when thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it.  and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee and shall serve thee. and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege it and when jehovah thy god delivereth it into thy hand thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword but the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which jehovah thy god hath given thee. thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations. but of the cities of these peoples that jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth but thou shalt utterly destroy them the hittite and the amorite the canaanite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite as jehovah thy god hath commanded thee  that they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so would ye sin against jehovah your god. when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for is the tree of the field man that it should be besieged of thee only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it fall. if one be found slain in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath smitten him then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain and it shall be that the city which is nearest unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke  and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water which is neither plowed nor sown and shall break the heifers neck there in the valley. and the priests the sons of levi shall come near for them jehovah thy god hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of jehovah and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. and all the elders of that city who are nearest unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley and they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it. forgive o jehovah thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and suffer not innocent blood [to remain] in the midst of thy people israel. and the blood shall be forgiven them. so shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of jehovah. when thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies and jehovah thy god delivereth them into thy hands and thou carriest them away captive  and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and thou hast a desire unto her and wouldest take her to thee to wife then thou shalt bring her home to thy house and she shall shave her head and pare her nails and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thy house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife. and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not deal with her as a slave because thou hast humbled her. if a man have two wives the one beloved and the other hated and they have borne him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated then it shall be in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated who is the firstborn but he shall acknowledge the firstborn the son of the hated by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his.  if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son that will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and though they chasten him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee and all israel shall hear and fear. and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt surely bury him the same day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thou defile not thy land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance. thou shalt not see thy brothers ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother.  and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him not then thou shalt bring it home to thy house and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it to him. and so shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do with his garment and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brothers which he hath lost and thou hast found thou mayest not hide thyself. thou shalt not see thy brothers ass or his ox fallen down by the way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. a woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a womans garment for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto jehovah thy god. if a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground with young ones or eggs and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam with the young thou shalt surely let the dam go but the young thou mayest take unto thyself that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days.  when thou buildest a new house then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thy house if any man fall from thence. thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed lest the whole fruit be forfeited the seed which thou hast sown and the increase of the vineyard. thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff wool and linen together. thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself. if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and lay shameful things to her charge and bring up an evil name upon her and say i took this woman and when i came nigh to her i found not in her the tokens of virginity then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate and the damsels father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth her  and lo he hath laid shameful things [to her charge] saying i found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity. and they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. and the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him and they shall fine him a hundred [shekels] of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days. but if this thing be true that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones because she hath wrought folly in israel to play the harlot in her fathers house so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband then they shall both of them die the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shalt thou put away the evil from israel. if there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her  then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them to death with stones the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbors wife so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. but if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field and the man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall die but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his neighbor and slayeth him even so is this matter for he found her in the field the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save her. if a man find a damsel that is a virgin that is not betrothed and lay hold

into the assembly of jehovah even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of jehovah for ever because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when ye

have a place also without the camp whither thou shalt go forth abroad and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons and it shall be when thou sittest down abroad thou shalt dig therewith and shalt

found some unseemly thing in her that he shall write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house.  and when she is departed out of his house she may go and be another mans [wife]. and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house or if the latter husband die who took her to be his

her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husbands brother unto her. and it shall be that the firstborn that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead that his name be not blotted out of israel.  and if the man like not to take his brothers wife then his brothers wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders and say my husbands brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in israel he will not perform the duty of a husbands brother unto me. then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand and say i like not to take her then shall his brothers wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and she shall answer and say so shall it be done unto the man

what amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of egypt how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee all that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary and he feared not god. therefore it shall be when jehovah thy god hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget. and it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and

basket and shalt go unto the place which jehovah thy god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.  and thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days and say unto him i profess this day unto jehovah thy god that i am come unto the land which jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us. and the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand and set it down before the altar of jehovah thy god. and thou shalt answer and say before jehovah thy god a syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and sojourned there few in number and he became there a nation great mighty and populous. and the egyptians dealt ill with us and afflicted us and laid upon us hard bondage and we cried unto jehovah the god of our fathers and jehovah heard our voice and saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression and jehovah brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and with wonders and he hath brought us into this place and hath given us this land a land flowing with milk and honey.  and now behold i have brought the first of the fruit of the ground which thou o jehovah hast given me. and thou shalt set it down before jehovah thy god and worship before jehovah thy god and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which jehovah thy god hath given unto thee and unto thy house thou and the levite and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee. when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year which is the year of tithing then thou shalt give it unto the levite to the sojourner to the fatherless and to the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filled. and thou shalt say before jehovah thy god i have put away the hallowed things out of my house and also have given them unto the levite and unto the sojourner to the fatherless and to the widow according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed any of thy commandments neither have i forgotten them  i have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have i put away thereof being unclean nor given thereof for the dead i have hearkened to the voice of jehovah my god i have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy people israel and the ground which thou hast given us as thou swarest unto our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey. this day jehovah thy god commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul. thou hast avouched jehovah this day to be thy god and that thou wouldest walk in his ways and keep his statutes and his commandments and his ordinances and hearken unto his voice and jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession as he hath promised thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made in praise and in name and in honor and that thou mayest be a holy people unto jehovah thy god as he hath spoken.  and moses and the elders of israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandment which i command you this day. and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the jordan unto the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaster them with plaster and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee a land flowing with milk and honey as jehovah the god of thy fathers hath promised thee. and it shall be when ye are passed over the jordan that ye shall set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal and thou shalt plaster them with plaster. and there shalt thou build an altar unto jehovah thy god an altar of stones thou shalt lift up no iron [tool] upon them. thou shalt build the altar of jehovah thy god of unhewn stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto jehovah thy god and thou shalt sacrifice peace offerings and shalt eat there and thou shalt rejoice before jehovah thy god. and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.  and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel saying keep silence and hearken o israel this day thou art become the people of jehovah thy god. thou shalt therefore obey the voice of jehovah thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day. and moses charged the people the same day saying these shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people when ye are passed over the jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph and benjamin. and these shall stand upon mount ebal for the curse reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali. and the levites shall answer and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image an abomination unto jehovah the work of the hands of the craftsman and setteth it up in secret. and all the people shall answer and say amen. cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that removeth his neighbors landmark. and all the people shall say amen.  cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that wresteth the justice [due] to the sojourner fatherless and widow. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife because he hath uncovered his fathers skirt. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that lieth with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that lieth with his motherinlaw. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. and all the people shall say amen. cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. and all the people shall say amen.  and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of jehovah thy god to observe to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that jehovah thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god. blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field. blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy beasts the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock. blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading trough. blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. jehovah will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee they shall come out against thee one way and shall flee before thee seven ways. jehovah will command the blessing upon thee in thy barns and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto and he will bless thee in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee.  jehovah will establish thee for a holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of jehovah thy god and walk in his ways. and all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of jehovah and they shall be afraid of thee. and jehovah will make thee plenteous for good in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which jehovah sware unto thy fathers to give thee. jehovah will open unto thee his good treasure the heavens to give the rain of thy land in its season and to bless all the work of thy hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow. and jehovah will make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of jehovah thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do [them] and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which i command you this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them.  but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee. cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field. cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading trough. cursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock. cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. jehovah will send upon thee cursing discomfiture and rebuke in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the evil of thy doings whereby thou hast forsaken me. jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it. jehovah will smite thee with consumption and with fever and with inflammation and with fiery heat and with the sword and with blasting and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.  and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed. jehovah will cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and shalt flee seven ways before them and thou shalt be tossed to and from among all the kingdoms of the earth. and thy dead body shall be food unto all birds of the heavens and unto the beasts of the earth and there shall be none to frighten them away. jehovah will smite thee with the boil of egypt and with the emerods and with the scurvy and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed. jehovah will smite thee with madness and with blindness and with astonishment of heart and thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed alway and there shall be none to save thee.  thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shalt build a house and thou shalt not dwell therein thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not use the fruit thereof. thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat thereof thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies and thou shalt have none to save thee. thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day and there shall be nought in the power of thy hand. the fruit of thy ground and all thy labors shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. jehovah will smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil whereof thou canst not be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head. jehovah will bring thee and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee unto a nation that thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers and there shalt thou serve other gods wood and stone.  and thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all the peoples whither jehovah shall lead thee away. thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather little in for the locust shall consume it. thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them but thou shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather [the grapes] for the worm shall eat them. thou shalt have olivetrees throughout all thy borders but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil for thine olive shall cast [its fruit]. thou shalt beget sons and daughters but they shall not be thine for they shall go into captivity.  all thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess. the sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher and thou shalt come down lower and lower. he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tail.  and all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of jehovah thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for ever. because thou servedst not jehovah thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart by reason of the abundance of all things therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that jehovah shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee. jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand a nation of fierce countenance that shall not regard the person of the old nor show favor to the young  and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy ground until thou be destroyed that also shall not leave thee grain new wine or oil the increase of thy cattle or the young of thy flock until they have caused thee to perish. and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fortified walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which jehovah thy god hath given thee. and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters whom jehovah thy god hath given thee in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee. the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates.  the tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughter  and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her children whom she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name jehovah thy god then jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance. and he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee. also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will jehovah bring upon thee until thou be destroyed.  and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god. and it shall come to pass that as jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish and to destroy you and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it. and jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth and there thou shalt serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers even wood and stone. and among these nations shalt thou find no ease and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot but jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and pining of soul and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear night and day and shalt have no assurance of thy life. in the morning thou shalt say would it were even and at even thou shalt say would it were morning for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  and jehovah will bring thee into egypt again with ships by the way whereof i said unto thee thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen and no man shall buy you. these are the words of the covenant which jehovah commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab besides the covenant which he made with them in horeb. and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that jehovah did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the great trials which thine eyes saw the signs and those great wonders but jehovah hath not given you a heart to know and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day. and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxed old upon you and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot. ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye may know that i am jehovah your god.  and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote them and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of the manassites. keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do. ye stand this day all of you before jehovah your god your heads your tribes your elders and your officers even all the men of israel your little ones your wives and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water that thou mayest enter into the covenant of jehovah thy god and into his oath which jehovah thy god maketh with thee this day that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people and that he may be unto thee a god as he spake unto thee and as he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob. neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath but with him that standeth here with us this day before jehovah our god and also with him that is not here with us this day  for ye know how we dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from jehovah our god to go to serve the gods of those nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the stubbornness of my heart to destroy the moist with the dry. jehovah will not pardon him but then the anger of jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him and jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven. and jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.  and the generation to come your children that shall rise up after you and the foreigner that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses wherewith jehovah hath made it sick [and that] the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt [and] a burning [that] it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboiim which jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath even all the nations shall say wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger then men shall say because they forsook the covenant of jehovah the god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt and went and served other gods and worshipped them gods that they knew not and that he had not given unto them therefore the anger of jehovah was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book  and jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as at this day. the secret things belong unto jehovah our god but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law. and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither jehovah thy god hath driven thee and shalt return unto jehovah thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thy heart and with all thy soul that then jehovah thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the peoples whither jehovah thy god hath scattered thee. if [any of] thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven from thence will jehovah thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee  and jehovah thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers. and jehovah thy god will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed to love jehovah thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live. and jehovah thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee that persecuted thee. and thou shalt return and obey the voice of jehovah and do all his commandments which i command thee this day. and jehovah thy god will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground for good for jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if thou shalt obey the voice of jehovah thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law if thou turn unto jehovah thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul. for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not too hard for thee neither is it far off.  it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us and make us to hear it that we may do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us and make us to hear it that we may do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it. see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that i command thee this day to love jehovah thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances that thou mayest live and multiply and that jehovah thy god may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. but if thy heart turn away and thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish ye shall not prolong your days in the land whither thou passest over the jordan to go in to possess it.  i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that i have set before thee life and death the blessing and the curse therefore choose life that thou mayest live thou and thy seed to love jehovah thy god to obey his voice and to cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which jehovah sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them. and moses went and spake these words unto all israel. and he said unto them i am a hundred and twenty years old this day i can no more go out and come in and jehovah hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan. jehovah thy god he will go over before thee he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt dispossess them [and] joshua he shall go over before thee as jehovah hath spoken. and jehovah will do unto them as he did to sihon and to og the kings of the amorites and unto their land whom he destroyed. and jehovah will deliver them up before you and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which i have commanded you.  be strong and of good courage fear not nor be affrighted at them for jehovah thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee. and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel be strong and of good courage for thou shalt go with this people into the land which jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. and jehovah he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed. and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah and unto all the elders of israel. and moses commanded them saying at the end of [every] seven years in the set time of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles when all israel is come to appear before jehovah thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing.  assemble the people the men and the women and the little ones and thy sojourner that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear jehovah your god and observe to do all the words of this law and that their children who have not known may hear and learn to fear jehovah your god as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the jordan to possess it. and jehovah said unto moses behold thy days approach that thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting that i may give him a charge. and moses and joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. and jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent. and jehovah said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them.  then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall come upon them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our god is not among us and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods. now therefore write ye this song for you and teach thou it the children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel. for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers flowing with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxed fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and despise me and break my covenant. and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are come upon them that this song shall testify before them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i know their imagination which they frame this day before i have brought them into the land which i sware.  so moses wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of israel. and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong and of good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee. and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished that moses commanded the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah saying take this book of the law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of jehovah your god that it may be there for a witness against thee. for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against jehovah and how much more after my death assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.  for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. and moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of israel the words of this song until they were finished. give ear ye heavens and i will speak and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender grass and as the showers upon the herb. for i will proclaim the name of jehovah ascribe ye greatness unto our god. the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are justice a god of faithfulness and without iniquity just and right is he. they have dealt corruptly with him [they are] not his children [it is] their blemish [they are] a perverse and crooked generation. do ye thus requite jehovah o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee he hath made thee and established thee.  remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will show thee thine elders and they will tell thee. when the most high gave to the nations their inheritance when he separated the children of men he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of israel. for jehovahs portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance. he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he compassed him about he cared for him he kept him as the apple of his eye. as an eagle that stirreth up her nest that fluttereth over her young he spread abroad his wings he took them he bare them on his pinions. jehovah alone did lead him and there was no foreign god with him. he made him ride on the high places of the earth and he did eat the increase of the field and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock butter of the herd and milk of the flock with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and goats with the finest of the wheat and of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.  but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxed fat thou art grown thick thou art become sleek then he forsook god who made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation. they moved him to jealousy with strange [gods] with abominations provoked they him to anger. they sacrificed unto demons [which were] no god to gods that they knew not to new [gods] that came up of late which your fathers dreaded not. of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that gave thee birth. and jehovah saw [it] and abhorred [them] because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very perverse generation children in whom is no faithfulness. they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  for a fire is kindled in mine anger and burneth unto the lowest sheol and devoureth the earth with its increase and setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains. i will heap evils upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them [they shall be] wasted with hunger and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction and the teeth of beasts will i send upon them with the poison of crawling things of the dust. without shall the sword bereave and in the chambers terror [it shall destroy] both young man and virgin the suckling with the man of gray hairs. i said i would scatter them afar i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men were it not that i feared the provocation of the enemy lest their adversaries should judge amiss lest they should say our hand is exalted and jehovah hath not done all this.  for they are a nation void of counsel and there is no understanding in them. oh that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end  how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and jehovah had delivered them up for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges. for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps. is not this laid up in store with me sealed up among my treasures vengeance is mine and recompense at the time when their foot shall slide for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. for jehovah will judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that [their] power is gone and there is none [remaining] shut up or left at large.  and he will say where are their gods the rock in which they took refuge which did eat the fat of their sacrifices [and] drank the wine of their drink offering let them rise up and help you let them be your protection.  see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. for i lift up my hand to heaven and say as i live for ever if i whet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine adversaries and will recompense them that hate me. i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives from the head of the leaders of the enemy. rejoice o ye nations [with] his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will make expiation for his land for his people. and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and hoshea the son of nun. and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel  and he said unto them set your heart unto all the words which i testify unto you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do [even] all the words of this law.  for it is no vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over the jordan to possess it. and jehovah spake unto moses that selfsame day saying get thee up into this mountain of abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of israel at the waters of meribah of kadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel. for thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go thither into the land which i give the children of israel. and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death.  and he said jehovah came from sinai and rose from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came from the ten thousands of holy ones at his right hand was a fiery law for them. yea he loveth the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet [every one] shall receive of thy words. moses commanded us a law an inheritance for the assembly of jacob. and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered all the tribes of israel together. let reuben live and not die nor let his men be few. and this is [the blessing] of judah and he said hear jehovah the voice of judah and bring him in unto his people. with his hands he contended for himself and thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. and of levi he said thy thummim and thy urim are with thy godly one whom thou didst prove at massah with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah who said of his father and of his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew he his own children for they have observed thy word and keep thy covenant.  they shall teach jacob thine ordinances and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burntoffering upon thine altar. bless jehovah his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise up against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again. of benjamin he said the beloved of jehovah shall dwell in safety by him he covereth him all the day long and he dwelleth between his shoulders. and of joseph he said blessed of jehovah be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun and for the precious things of the growth of the moons and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the everlasting hills and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. let [the blessing] come upon the head of joseph and upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.  the firstling of his herd majesty is his and his horns are the horns of the wild ox with them he shall push the peoples all of them [even] the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh. and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents. they shall call the peoples unto the mountain there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand. and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lioness and teareth the arm yea the crown of the head. and he provided the first part for himself for there was the lawgivers portion reserved and he came [with] the heads of the people he executed the righteousness of jehovah and his ordinances with israel. and of dan he said dan is a lions whelp that leapeth forth from bashan. and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favor and full with the blessing of jehovah possess thou the west and the south.  and of asher he said blessed be asher with children let him be acceptable unto his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil. thy bars shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be. there is none like unto god o jeshurun who rideth upon the heavens for thy help and in his excellency on the skies. the eternal god is [thy] dwelling place and underneath are the everlasting arms. and he thrust out the enemy from before thee and said destroy. and israel dwelleth in safety the fountain of jacob alone in a land of grain and new wine yea his heavens drop down dew. happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee a people saved by jehovah the shield of thy help and the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places. and moses went up from the plains of moab unto mount nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho. and jehovah showed him all the land of gilead unto dan and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto the hinder sea  and the south and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palmtrees unto zoar. and jehovah said unto him this is the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thither. so moses the servant of jehovah died there in the land of moab according to the word of jehovah. and he buried him in the valley in the land of moab over against beth peor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. and moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated. and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping in the mourning for moses were ended. and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as jehovah commanded moses. and there hath not arisen a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom jehovah knew face to face  in all the signs and the wonders which jehovah sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land and in all the mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses wrought in the sight of all israel. now it came to pass after the death of moses the servant of jehovah that jehovah spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel. every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon to you have i given it as i spake unto moses. from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your border. there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee. be strong and of good courage for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them.  only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success. have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not affrighted neither be thou dismayed for jehovah thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest. then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye are to pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which jehovah your god giveth you to possess it. and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying  remember the word which moses the servant of jehovah commanded you saying jehovah your god giveth you rest and will give you this land. your wives your little ones and your cattle shall abide in the land which moses gave you beyond the jordan but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valor and shall help them until jehovah have given your brethren rest as [he hath given] you and they also have possessed the land which jehovah your god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and possess it which moses the servant of jehovah gave you beyond the jordan toward the sunrising. and they answered joshua saying all that thou hast commanded us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only jehovah thy god be with thee as he was with moses. whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of good courage.  and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men as spies secretly saying go view the land and jericho. and they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was rahab and lay there. and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of israel to search out the land. and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee that are entered into thy house for they are come to search out all the land. and the woman took the two men and hid them and she said yea the men came unto me but i knew not whence they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went i know not pursue after them quickly for ye will overtake them. but she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof. and the men pursued after them the way to the jordan unto the fords and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate.  and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men i know that jehovah hath given you the land and that the fear of you is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. for we have heard how jehovah dried up the water of the red sea before you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were beyond the jordan unto sihon and to og whom ye utterly destroyed. and as soon as we had heard it our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you for jehovah your god he is god in heaven above and on earth beneath. now therefore i pray you swear unto me by jehovah since i have dealt kindly with you that ye also will deal kindly with my fathers house and give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and will deliver our lives from death. and the men said unto her our life for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when jehovah giveth us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.  then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the side of the wall and she dwelt upon the wall. and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers light upon you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way. and the men said unto her we will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy fathers household. and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we shall be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him. but if thou utter this our business then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. and she said according unto your words so be it. and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window.  and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not. then the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and they told him all that had befallen them. and they said unto joshua truly jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us. and joshua rose up early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to the jordan he and all the children of israel and they lodged there before they passed over. and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the midst of the camp and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of jehovah your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it.  yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore. and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow jehovah will do wonders among you. and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people. and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people. and jehovah said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee. and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the waters of the jordan ye shall stand still in the jordan. and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of jehovah your god. and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanite and the hittite and the hivite and the perizzite and the girgashite and the amorite and the jebusite.  behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the jordan. now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel for every tribe a man. and it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of jehovah the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of the jordan that the waters of the jordan shall be cut off even the waters that come down from above and they shall stand in one heap. and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the jordan the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people and when they that bare the ark were come unto the jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water for the jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in one heap a great way off at adam the city that is beside zarethan and those that went down toward the sea of the arabah even the salt sea were wholly cut off and the people passed over right against jericho.  and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the jordan and all israel passed over on dry ground until all the nation were passed clean over the jordan. and it came to pass when all the nation were clean passed over the jordan that jehovah spake unto joshua saying take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe a man and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of the jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodgingplace where ye shall lodge this night. then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe a man and joshua said unto them pass over before the ark of jehovah your god into the midst of the jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones  then ye shall say unto them because the waters of the jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of jehovah when it passed over the jordan the waters of the jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever. and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the jordan as jehovah spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there. and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the jordan in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day. for the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the jordan until everything was finished that jehovah commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over. and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of jehovah passed over and the priests in the presence of the people.  and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the halftribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before jehovah unto battle to the plains of jericho. on that day jehovah magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life. and jehovah spake unto joshua saying command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of the jordan. joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of the jordan. and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah were come up out of the midst of the jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry ground that the waters of the jordan returned unto their place and went over all its banks as aforetime. and the people came up out of the jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal on the east border of jericho. and those twelve stones which they took out of the jordan did joshua set up in gilgal.  and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land. for jehovah your god dried up the waters of the jordan from before you until ye were passed over as jehovah your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were passed over that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of jehovah that it is mighty that ye may fear jehovah your god for ever. and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites that were beyond the jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites that were by the sea heard how that jehovah had dried up the waters of the jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel. at that time jehovah said unto joshua make thee knives of flint and circumcise again the children of israel the second time.  and joshua made him knives of lint and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins.  and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came forth out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came forth out of egypt. for all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt they had not circumcised. for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the nation even the men of war that came forth out of egypt were consumed because they hearkened not unto the voice of jehovah unto whom jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey. and their children whom he raised up in their stead them did joshua circumcise for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way. and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the nation that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole.  and jehovah said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you. wherefore the name of that place was called gilgal unto this day. and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho. and they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched grain in the selfsame day. and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the produce of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year. and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but [as] prince of the host of jehovah am i now come. and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant  and the prince of jehovahs host said unto joshua put off thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy. and joshua did so. now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in. and jehovah said unto joshua see i have given into thy hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor. and ye shall compass the city all the men of war going about the city once. thus shalt thou do six days. and seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow the trumpets. and it shall be that when they make a long blast with the rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall go up every man straight before him. and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of jehovah.  and they said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of jehovah. and it was so that when joshua had spoken unto the people the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns before jehovah passed on and blew the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of jehovah followed them. and the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets and the rearward went after the ark [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went. and joshua commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor let your voice be heard neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout. so he caused the ark of jehovah to compass the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp. and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of jehovah.  and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of jehovah went on continually and blew the trumpets and the armed men went before them and the rearward came after the ark of jehovah [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went. and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days. and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on the day they compassed the city seven times. and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for jehovah hath given you the city. and the city shall be devoted even it and all that is therein to jehovah only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent. but as for you only keep yourselves from the devoted thing lest when ye have devoted it ye take of the devoted thing so would ye make the camp of israel accursed and trouble it.  but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are holy unto jehovah they shall come into the treasury of jehovah. so the people shouted and [the priests] blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet that the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city. and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman both young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword. and joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her. and the young men the spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had all her kindred also they brought out and they set them without the camp of israel. and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of jehovah.  but rahab the harlot and her fathers household and all that she had did joshua save alive and she dwelt in the midst of israel unto this day because she hid the messengers whom joshua sent to spy out jericho. and joshua charged them with an oath at that time saying cursed be the man before jehovah that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho with the loss of his first born shall he lay the foundation thereof and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. so jehovah was with joshua and his fame was in all the land. but the children of israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the devoted thing and the anger of jehovah was kindled against the children of israel. and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside beth aven on the east side of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and spy out the land. and the men went up and spied out ai.  and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai make not all the people to toil thither for they are but few. so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai. and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men and they chased them [from] before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them at the descent and the hearts of the people melted and became as water. and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of jehovah until the evening he and the elders of israel and they put dust upon their heads. and joshua said alas o lord jehovah wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to cause us to perish would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the jordan oh lord what shall i say after that israel hath turned their backs before their enemies  for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will compass us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do for thy great name and jehovah said unto joshua get thee up wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face israel hath sinned yea they have even transgressed my covenant which i commanded them yea they have even taken of the devoted thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have even put it among their own stuff. therefore the children of israel cannot stand before their enemies they turn their backs before their enemies because they are become accursed i will not be with you any more except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you. up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus saith jehovah the god of israel there is a devoted thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.  in the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which jehovah taketh shall come near by families and the family which jehovah shall take shall come near by households and the household which jehovah shall take shall come near man by man. and it shall be that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of jehovah and because he hath wrought folly in israel. so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel near by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken and he brought near the family of judah and he took the family of the zerahites and he brought near the family of the zerahites man by man and zabdi was taken and he brought near his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken. and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to jehovah the god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me.  and achan answered joshua and said of a truth i have sinned against jehovah the god of israel and thus and thus have i done when i saw among the spoil a goodly babylonish mantle and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it. so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it. and they took them from the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and they laid them down before jehovah. and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them up unto the valley of achor. and joshua said why hast thou troubled us jehovah shall trouble thee this day. and all israel stoned him with stones and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.  and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day and jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day. and jehovah said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves set thee an ambush for the city behind it. so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up to ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand men the mighty men of valor and sent them forth by night. and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in ambush against the city behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city. and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them  and they will come out after us till we have drawn them away from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first so we will flee before them and ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city for jehovah your god will deliver it into your hand. and it shall be when ye have seized upon the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the word of jehovah shall ye do see i have commanded you. and joshua sent them forth and they went to the ambushment and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people. and joshua arose up early in the morning and mustered the people and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai. and all the people [even] the [men of] war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and encamped on the north side of ai now there was a valley between him and ai. and he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city.  so they set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liersinwait that were on the west of the city and joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to battle he and all his people at the time appointed before the arabah but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city. and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness. and all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from the city. and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel. and jehovah said unto joshua stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thy hand. and joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.  and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and entered into the city and took it and they hasted and set the city on fire. and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of ai. and the others came forth out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape. and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua. and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they pursued them and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all israel returned unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword.  and all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai. for joshua drew not back his hand wherewith he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai. only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for prey unto themselves according unto the word of jehovah which he commanded joshua. so joshua burnt ai and made it a heap for ever even a desolation unto this day. and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide and at the going down of the sun joshua commanded and they took his body down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised thereon a great heap of stones unto this day. then joshua built an altar unto jehovah the god of israel in mount ebal as moses the servant of jehovah commanded the children of israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of unhewn stones upon which no man had lifted up any iron and they offered thereon burntofferings unto jehovah and sacrificed peaceofferings. and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel.  and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah as well the sojourner as the homeborn half of them in front of mount gerizim and half of them in front of mount ebal as moses the servant of jehovah had commanded at the first that they should bless the people of israel. and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessing and the curse according to all that is written in the book of the law. there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before all the assembly of israel and the women and the little ones and the sojourners that were among them. and it came to pass when all the kings that were beyond the jordan in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the shore of the great sea in front of lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord.  but when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai they also did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine skins old and rent and bound up and old and patched shoes upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy. and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we are come from a far country now therefore make ye a covenant with us. and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a covenant with you  and they said unto joshua we are thy servants. and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of jehovah thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond the jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan who was at ashtaroth.  and our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take provision in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants and now make ye a covenant with us. this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and is become mouldy and these wine skins which we filled were new and behold they are rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. and the men took of their provision and asked not counsel at the mouth of jehovah. and joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.  and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them that they heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them. and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day. now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kiriathjearim.  and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by jehovah the god of israel. and all the congregation murmured against the princes. but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by jehovah the god of israel now therefore we may not touch them. this we will do to them and let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them. and the princes said unto them let them live so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had spoken unto them. and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us  now therefore ye are cursed and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god.  and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that jehovah thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you and have done this thing. and now behold we are in thy hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do. and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not. and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of jehovah unto this day in the place which he should choose. now it came to pass when adonizedek king of jerusalem heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty.  wherefore adoni zedek king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying come up unto me and help me and let us smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel. therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped against gibeon and made war against it. and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us. so joshua went up from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor. and jehovah said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thy hands there shall not a man of them stand before thee. joshua therefore came upon them suddenly [for] he went up from gilgal all the night.  and jehovah discomfited them before israel and he slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of beth horon and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah. and it came to pass as they fled from before israel while they were at the descent of beth horon that jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword. then spake joshua to jehovah in the day when jehovah delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of aijalon. and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. is not this written in the book of jashar and the sun stayed in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day. and there was no day like that before it or after it that jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man for jehovah fought for israel.  and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal. and these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at makkedah. and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hidden in the cave at makkedah. and joshua said roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave and set men by it to keep them but stay not ye pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for jehovah your god hath delivered them into your hand. and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities that all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel. then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave. and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon.  and it came to pass when they brought forth those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings. and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them. and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight. and afterward joshua smote them and put them to death and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave unto this very day. and joshua took makkedah on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining and he did to the king of makkedah as he had done unto the king of jericho.  and joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto libnah and fought against libnah and jehovah delivered it also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining in it and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of jericho. and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto lachish and encamped against it and fought against it and jehovah delivered lachish into the hand of israel and he took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah. then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining. and joshua passed from lachish and all israel with him unto eglon and they encamped against it and fought against it and they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to lachish.  and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto hebron and they fought against it and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but he utterly destroyed it and all the souls that were therein. and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and fought against it and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to the king thereof. so joshua smote all the land the hillcountry and the south and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings he left none remaining but he utterly destroyed all that breathed as jehovah the god of israel commanded. and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all the country of goshen even unto gibeon.  and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time because jehovah the god of israel fought for israel. and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal. and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor heard thereof that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph and to the kings that were on the north in the hill country and in the arabah south of chinneroth and in the lowland and in the heights of dor on the west to the canaanite on the east and on the west and the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the hillcountry and the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpah. and they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with horses and chariots very many. and all these kings met together and they came and encamped together at the waters of merom to fight with israel.  and jehovah said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for tomorrow at this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hock their horses and burn their chariots with fire. so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them by the waters of merom suddenly and fell upon them. and jehovah delivered them into the hand of israel and they smote them and chased them unto great sidon and unto misrephoth maim and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they left them none remaining. and joshua did unto them as jehovah bade him he hocked their horses and burnt their chariots with fire. and joshua turned back at that time and took hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was none left that breathed and he burnt hazor with fire. and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them did joshua take and he smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of jehovah commanded.  but as for the cities that stood on their mounds israel burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn. and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither left they any that breathed. as jehovah commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that jehovah commanded moses. so joshua took all that land the hillcountry and all the south and all the land of goshen and the lowland and the arabah and the hillcountry of israel and the lowland of the same from mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and put them to death. joshua made war a long time with all those kings. there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon they took all in battle.  for it was of jehovah to harden their hearts to come against israel in battle that he might utterly destroy them that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as jehovah commanded moses. and joshua came at that time and cut off the anakim from the hillcountry from hebron from debir from anab and from all the hillcountry of judah and from all the hill country of israel joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. there was none of the anakim left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod did some remain. so joshua took the whole land according to all that jehovah spake unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes. and the land had rest from war. now these are the kings of the land whom the children of israel smote and possessed their land beyond the jordan toward the sunrising from the valley of the arnon unto mount hermon and all the arabah eastward  sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and ruled from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley and half gilead even unto the river jabbok the border of the children of ammon and the arabah unto the sea of chinneroth eastward and unto the sea of the arabah even the salt sea eastward the way to beth jeshimoth and on the south under the slopes of pisgah and the border of og king of bashan of the remnant of the rephaim who dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei and ruled in mount hermon and in salecah and in all bashan unto the border of the geshurites and the maacathites and half gilead the border of sihon king of heshbon. moses the servant of jehovah and the children of israel smote them and moses the servant of jehovah gave it for a possession unto the reubenites and the gadites and the halftribe of manasseh.  and these are the kings of the land whom joshua and the children of israel smote beyond the jordan westward from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto mount halak that goeth up to seir and joshua gave it unto the tribes of israel for a possession according to their divisions in the hillcountry and in the lowland and in the arabah and in the slopes and in the wilderness and in the south the hittite the amorite and the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite the king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one the king of eglon one the king of gezer one the king of debir one the king of geder one the king of hormah one the king of arad one the king of libnah one the king of adullam one the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one the king of aphek one the king of lassharon one the king of madon one the king of hazor one  the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph one the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam in carmel one the king of dor in the height of dor one the king of goiim in gilgal one the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and one. now joshua was old and well stricken in years and jehovah said unto him thou art old and well stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. this is the land that yet remaineth all the regions of the philistines and all the geshurites from the shihor which is before egypt even unto the border of ekron northward [which] is reckoned to the canaanites the five lords of the philistines the gazites and the ashdodites the ashkelonites the gittites and the ekronites also the avvim on the south all the land of the canaanites and mearah that belongeth to the sidonians unto aphek to the border of the amorites and the land of the gebalites and all lebanon toward the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entrance of hamath  all the inhabitants of the hillcountry from lebanon unto misrephoth maim even all the sidonians them will i drive out from before the children of israel only allot thou it unto israel for an inheritance as i have commanded thee. now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the halftribe of manasseh. with him the reubenites and the gadites received their inheritance which moses gave them beyond the jordan eastward even as moses the servant of jehovah gave them from aroer that is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the plain of medeba unto dibon and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of ammon and gilead and the border of the geshurites and maacathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salecah all the kingdom of og in bashan who reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei the same was left of the remnant of the rephaim for these did moses smite and drove them out.  nevertheless the children of israel drove not out the geshurites nor the maacathites but geshur and maacath dwell in the midst of israel unto this day. only unto the tribe of levi he gave no inheritance the offerings of jehovah the god of israel made by fire are his inheritance as he spake unto him. and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben according to their families. and their border was from aroer that is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by medeba heshbon and all its cities that are in the plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon and jahaz and kedemoth and mephaath and kiriathaim and sibmah and zerethshahar in the mount of the valley and bethpeor and the slopes of pisgah and bethjeshimoth and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the chiefs of midian evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba the princes of sihon that dwelt in the land. balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.  and the border of the children of reuben was the jordan and the border [thereof]. this was the inheritance of the children of reuben according to their families the cities and the villages thereof. and moses gave unto the tribe of gad unto the children of gad according to their families. and their border was jazer and all the cities of gilead and half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before rabbah and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and from mahanaim unto the border of debir and in the valley bethharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon the jordan and the border [thereof] unto the uttermost part of the sea of chinnereth beyond the jordan eastward. this is the inheritance of the children of gad according to their families the cities and the villages thereof. and moses gave [inheritance] unto the halftribe of manasseh and it was for the half tribe of the children of manasseh according to their families.  and their border was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan threescore cities and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei the cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were for the children of machir the son of manasseh even for the half of the children of machir according to their families.  these are the inheritances which moses distributed in the plains of moab beyond the jordan at jericho eastward. but unto the tribe of levi moses gave no inheritance jehovah the god of israel is their inheritance as he spake unto them. and these are the inheritances which the children of israel took in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers [houses] of the tribes of the children of israel distributed unto them by the lot of their inheritance as jehovah commanded by moses for the nine tribes and for the halftribe. for moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the halftribe beyond the jordan but unto the levites he gave no inheritance among them.  for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim and they gave no portion unto the levites in the land save cities to dwell in with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance. as jehovah commanded moses so the children of israel did and they divided the land.  then the children of judah drew nigh unto joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite said unto him thou knowest the thing that jehovah spake unto moses the man of god concerning me and concerning thee in kadesh barnea. forty years old was i when moses the servant of jehovah sent me from kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart. nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed jehovah my god. and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever because thou hast wholly followed jehovah my god.  and now behold jehovah hath kept me alive as he spake these forty and five years from the time that jehovah spake this word unto moses while israel walked in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old. as yet i am as strong this day as i as in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war and to go out and to come in.  now therefore give me this hill country whereof jehovah spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakim were there and cities great and fortified it may be that jehovah will be with me and i shall drive them out as jehovah spake. and joshua blessed him and he gave hebron unto caleb the son of jephunneh for an inheritance. therefore hebron became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite unto this day because that he wholly followed jehovah the god of israel. now the name of hebron beforetime was kiriatharba [which arba was] the greatest man among the anakim. and the land had rest from war.  and the lot for the tribe of

according to their families. and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of judah according to the commandment of jehovah to joshua even kiriatharba [which arba was] the father of anak the same is hebron. and caleb drove out thence the three sons of anak sheshai and ahiman and talmai the children of anak. and he went up thence against the inhabitants of debir now the name of debir beforetime was kiriathsepher. and caleb said he that smiteth kiriathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife. and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife. and it came to pass when she came [unto him] that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she alighted from off her ass and caleb said what wouldest thou  and she said give me a blessing for that thou hast set me in the land of the south give me also springs of water. and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. this is the

through the hillcountry to bethel and it went out from bethel to luz and passed along unto the border of the archites to ataroth  and it went down westward to the border of the japhletites unto the border of bethhoron the nether even unto gezer and the goings out thereof were at the sea. and the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their inheritance. and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was [thus] the border of their inheritance eastward was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper and the border went out westward at michmethath on the north and the

families together with the cities which were set apart for the children of ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their villages.  and they drove not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwell in the midst of ephraim unto this day and are become servants to do taskwork. and [this] was the lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the firstborn of joseph. as for machir the first born of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and bashan. so [the lot] was for the rest of the children of manasseh according to their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph according to their families. but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah.  and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying jehovah commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. and there fell ten parts to manasseh besides the land of gilead and bashan which is beyond the jordan because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. and the land of gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of manasseh. and the border of manasseh was from asher to michmethath which is before shechem and the border went along to the right hand unto the inhabitants of en tappuah. the land of tappuah belonged to manasseh but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim.  and the border went down unto the brook of kanah southward of the brook these cities belonged to ephraim among the cities of manasseh and the border of manasseh was on the north side of the brook and the goings out thereof were at the sea southward it was ephraims and northward it was manassehs and the sea was his border and they reached to asher on the north and to issachar on the east. and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and its towns and ibleam and its towns and the inhabitants of dor and its towns and the inhabitants of en dor and its towns and the inhabitants of taanach and its towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and its towns even the three heights. yet the children of manasseh could not drive out [the inhabitants of] those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land. and it came to pass when the children of israel were waxed strong that they put the canaanites to taskwork and did not utterly drive them out.  and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance seeing i am a great people forasmuch as hitherto jehovah hath blessed me and joshua said unto them if thou be a great people get thee up to the forest and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the rephaim since the hill country of ephraim is too narrow for thee. and the children of joseph said the hillcountry is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are in beth shean and its towns and they who are in the valley of jezreel. and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot only but the hill country shall be thine for though it is a forest thou shalt cut it down and the goings out thereof shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though they have chariots of iron and though they are strong.  and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled themselves together at shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there and the land was subdued before them. and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet divided their inheritance. and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye slack to go in to possess the land which jehovah the god of your fathers hath given you appoint for you three men of each tribe and i will send them and they shall arise and walk through the land and describe it according to their inheritance and they shall come unto me. and they shall divide it into seven portions judah shall abide in his border on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their border on the north. and ye shall describe the land into seven portions and bring [the description] hither to me and i will cast lots for you here before jehovah our god.  for the levites have no portion among you for the priesthood of jehovah is their inheritance and gad and reuben and the halftribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the jordan eastward which moses the servant of jehovah gave them. and the men arose and went and joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me and i will cast lots for you here before jehovah in shiloh. and the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven portions in a book and they came to joshua unto the camp at shiloh. and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before jehovah and there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to

joshua saying speak to the children of israel saying assign you the cities of refuge whereof i spake unto you by moses that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly [and] unawares may flee thither and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. and he shall flee unto one of those cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city and they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them. and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand because he smote his neighbor unawares and hated him not beforetime.  and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the manslayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled. and they set apart kedesh

stood before the congregation. then came near the heads of fathers [houses] of the levites unto eleazar the priest and unto joshua the son of nun and unto the heads of fathers [houses] of the tribes of the children of israel  and they spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan saying jehovah commanded moses to give us cities to dwell in with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. and the

rest of the families of the levites and their lot was twelve cities. all the cities of the levites in the midst of the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them thus it was with all these cities. so jehovah gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein. and jehovah gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand. there failed not aught of any good thing which jehovah had spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass. then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the halftribe of manasseh and said unto them ye have kept all that moses the servant of jehovah commanded you and have hearkened unto my voice in all that i commanded you  ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of jehovah your god. and now jehovah your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he spake unto them therefore now turn ye and get you unto your tents unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of jehovah gave you beyond the jordan. only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of jehovah commanded you to love jehovah your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents. now to the one halftribe of manasseh moses had given [inheritance] in bashan but unto the other half gave joshua among their brethren beyond the jordan westward moreover when joshua sent them away unto their tents he blessed them  and spake unto them saying return with much wealth unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the land of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the commandment of jehovah by moses. and when they came unto the region about the jordan that is in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the halftribe of manasseh built there an altar by the jordan a great altar to look upon. and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the halftribe of manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of canaan in the region about the jordan on the side that pertaineth to the children of israel.  and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up against them to war. and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the halftribe of manasseh into the land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and with him ten princes one prince of a fathers house for each of the tribes of israel and they were every one of them head of their fathers houses among the thousands of israel. and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the halftribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying thus saith the whole congregation of jehovah what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following jehovah in that ye have builded you an altar to rebel this day against jehovah is the iniquity of peor too little for us from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day although there came a plague upon the congregation of jehovah  that ye must turn away this day from following jehovah and it will be seeing ye rebel today against jehovah that tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel. howbeit if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of jehovah wherein jehovahs tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against jehovah nor rebel against us in building you an altar besides the altar of jehovah our god. did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing and wrath fell upon all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered and spake unto the heads of the thousands of israel the mighty one god jehovah the mighty one god jehovah he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in trespass against jehovah save thou us not this day  that we have built us an altar to turn away from following jehovah or if to offer thereon burntoffering or mealoffering or if to offer sacrifices of peaceofferings thereon let jehovah himself require it and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this [and] of purpose saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with jehovah the god of israel for jehovah hath made the jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no portion in jehovah so might your children make our children cease from fearing jehovah. therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burntoffering nor for sacrifice but it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us that we may do the service of jehovah before him with our burntofferings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no portion in jehovah.  therefore said we it shall be when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we shall say behold the pattern of the altar of jehovah which our fathers made not for burntoffering nor for sacrifice but it is a witness between us and you. far be it from us that we should rebel against jehovah and turn away this day from following jehovah to build an altar for burnt offering for meal offering or for sacrifice besides the altar of jehovah our god that is before his tabernacle. and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation even the heads of the thousands of israel that were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them well. and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we know that jehovah is in the midst of us because ye have not committed this trespass against jehovah now have ye delivered the children of israel out of the hand of jehovah.  and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again. and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and spake no more of going up against them to war to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and the children of gad dwelt. and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar [ed] for [said they] it is a witness between us that jehovah is god. and it came to pass after many days when jehovah had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about and joshua was old and well stricken in years that joshua called for all israel for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and well stricken in years and ye have seen all that jehovah your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for jehovah your god he it is that hath fought for you.  behold i have allotted unto you these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from the jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun. and jehovah your god he will thrust them out from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as jehovah your god spake unto you. therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear [by them] neither serve them nor bow down yourselves unto them but cleave unto jehovah your god as ye have done unto this day. for jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath stood before you unto this day. one man of you shall chase a thousand for jehovah your god he it is that fighteth for you as he spake unto you. take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love jehovah your god.  else if ye do at all go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you know for a certainty that jehovah your god will no more drive these nations from out of your sight but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you and a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which jehovah your god hath given you. and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which jehovah your god spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you not one thing hath failed thereof. and it shall come to pass that as all the good things are come upon you of which jehovah your god spake unto you so will jehovah bring upon you all the evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which jehovah your god hath given you.  when ye transgress the covenant of jehovah your god which he commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down yourselves to them then will the anger of jehovah be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you. and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god. and joshua said unto all the people thus saith jehovah the god of israel your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the river even terah the father of abraham and the father of nahor and they served other gods. and i took your father abraham from beyond the river and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac.  and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount seir to possess it and jacob and his children went down into egypt. and i sent moses and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did in the midst thereof and afterward i brought you out.  and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the red sea. and when they cried out unto jehovah he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes saw what i did in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days. and i brought you into the land of the amorites that dwelt beyond the jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand and ye possessed their land and i destroyed them from before you. then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and fought against israel and he sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his hand. and ye went over the jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorite and the perizzite and the canaanite and the hittite and the girgashite the hivite and the jebusite and i delivered them into your hand.  and i sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites not with thy sword nor with thy bow. and i gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored and cities which ye built not and ye dwell therein of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. now therefore fear jehovah and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the river and in egypt and serve ye jehovah. and if it seem evil unto you to serve jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve jehovah. and the people answered and said far be it from us that we should forsake jehovah to serve other gods for jehovah our god he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and that did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed  and jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples even the amorites that dwelt in the land therefore we also will serve jehovah for he is our god. and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve jehovah for he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins. if ye forsake jehovah and serve foreign gods then he will turn and do you evil and consume you after that he hath done you good. and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve jehovah. and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you jehovah to serve him. and they said we are witnesses. now therefore put away [said he] the foreign gods which are among you and incline your heart unto jehovah the god of israel. and the people said unto joshua jehovah our god will we serve and unto his voice will we hearken. so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem. and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and he took a great stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of jehovah.  and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness against us for it hath heard all the words of jehovah which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness against you lest ye deny your god. so joshua sent the people away every man unto his inheritance. and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of nun the servant of jehovah died being a hundred and ten years old. and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which is in the hillcountry of ephraim on the north of the mountain of gaash. and israel served jehovah all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua and had known all the work of jehovah that he had wrought for israel. and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in the parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred pieces of money and they became the inheritance of the children of joseph. and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in the hill of phinehas his son which was given him in the hillcountry of ephraim.  and it came to pass after the death of joshua that the children of israel asked of jehovah saying who shall go up for us first against the canaanites to fight against them and jehovah said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand. and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot. so simeon went with him. and judah went up and jehovah delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand and they smote of them in bezek ten thousand men. and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they smote the canaanites and the perizzites. but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered [their food] under my table as i have done so god hath requited me. and they brought him to jerusalem and he died there. and the children of judah fought against jerusalem and took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.  and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the hillcountry and in the south and in the lowland. and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron beforetime was kiriatharba and they smote sheshai and ahiman and talmai. and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir. now the name of debir beforetime was kiriathsepher. and caleb said he that smiteth kiriathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife. and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife. and it came to pass when she came [unto him] that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she alighted from off her ass and caleb said unto her what wouldest thou and she said unto him give me a blessing for that thou hast set me in the land of the south give me also springs of water. and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.  and the children of the kenite moses brother inlaw went up out of the city of palmtrees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which is in the south of arad and they went and dwelt with the people. and judah went with simeon his brother and they smote the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it. and the name of the city was called hormah. also judah took gaza with the border thereof and ashkelon with the border thereof and ekron with the border thereof. and jehovah was with judah and drove out [the inhabitants of] the hill country for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses had spoken and he drove out thence the three sons of anak. and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day. and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and jehovah was with them. and the house of joseph sent to spy out bethel. now the name of the city beforetime was luz.  and the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him show us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will deal kindly with thee. and he showed them the entrance into the city and they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let the man go and all his family. and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this day. and manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] bethshean and its towns nor [of] taanach and its towns nor the inhabitants of dor and its towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and its towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and its towns but the canaanites would dwell in that land. and it came to pass when israel was waxed strong that they put the canaanites to taskwork and did not utterly drive them out. and ephraim drove not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them. zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and became subject to taskwork.  asher drove not out the inhabitants of acco nor the inhabitants of sidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out. naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of beth anath became subject to taskwork. and the amorites forced the children of dan into the hill country for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became subject to taskwork. and the border of the amorites was from the ascent of akrabbim from the rock and upward. and the angel of jehovah came up from gilgal to bochim. and he said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you  and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ye shall break down their altars. but ye have not hearkened unto my voice why have ye done this wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you. and it came to pass when the angel of jehovah spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept. and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto jehovah. now when joshua had sent the people away the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. and the people served jehovah all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great work of jehovah that he had wrought for israel. and joshua the son of nun the servant of jehovah died being a hundred and ten years old. and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the hillcountry of ephraim on the north of the mountain of gaash.  and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them that knew not jehovah nor yet the work which he had wrought for israel. and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and served the baalim and they forsook jehovah the god of their fathers who brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them and bowed themselves down unto them and they provoked jehovah to anger. and they forsook jehovah and served baal and the ashtaroth. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. whithersoever they went out the hand of jehovah was against them for evil as jehovah had spoken and as jehovah had sworn unto them and they were sore distressed. and jehovah raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.  and yet they hearkened not unto their judges for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down unto them they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked obeying the commandments of jehovah [but] they did not so. and when jehovah raised them up judges then jehovah was with the judge and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. but it came to pass when the judge was dead that they turned back and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their doings nor from their stubborn way. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he said because this nation have transgressed my covenant which i commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that joshua left when he died that by them i may prove israel whether they will keep the way of jehovah to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not.  so jehovah left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua. now these are the nations which jehovah left to prove israel by them even as many [of israel] as had not known all the wars of canaan only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof [namely] the five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount baal hermon unto the entrance of hamath. and they were [left] to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of jehovah which he commanded their fathers by moses. and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods. and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and forgat jehovah their god and served the baalim and the asheroth.  therefore the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he sold them into the hand of cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel served cushan rishathaim eight years. and when the children of israel cried unto jehovah jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of israel who saved them even othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother. and the spirit of jehovah came upon him and he judged israel and he went out to war and jehovah delivered cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against cushan rishathaim. and the land had rest forty years. and othniel the son of kenaz died. and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and jehovah strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel because they had done that which was evil in the sight of jehovah. and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and he went and smote israel and they possessed the city of palmtrees. and the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years.  but when the children of israel cried unto jehovah jehovah raised them up a saviour ehud the son of gera the benjamite a man lefthanded. and the children of israel sent tribute by him unto eglon the king of moab. and ehud made him a sword which had two edges a cubit in length and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. and he offered the tribute unto eglon king of moab now eglon was a very fat man. and when he had made an end of offering the tribute he sent away the people that bare the tribute. but he himself turned back from the quarries that were by gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king. and he said keep silence. and all that stood by him went out from him. and ehud came unto him and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. and ehud said i have a message from god unto thee. and he arose out of his seat. and ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his body and the haft also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade for he drew not the sword out of his body and it came out behind.  then ehud went forth into the porch and shut the doors of the upper room upon him and locked them. now when he was gone out his servants came and they saw and behold the doors of the upper room were locked and they said surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber. and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the upper room therefore they took the key and opened [them] and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto seirah. and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the hillcountry of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him from the hill country and he before them. and he said unto them follow after me for jehovah hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand. and they went down after him and took the fords of the jordan against the moabites and suffered not a man to pass over. and they smote of moab at that time about ten thousand men every lusty man and every man of valor and there escaped not a man.  so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel. and the land had rest fourscore years. and after him was shamgar the son of anath who smote of the philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad and he also saved israel. and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah when ehud was dead. and jehovah sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera who dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles. and the children of israel cried unto jehovah for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel. now deborah a prophetess the wife of lappidoth she judged israel at that time. and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in the hillcountry of ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment. and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedesh naphtali and said unto him hath not jehovah the god of israel commanded [saying] go and draw unto mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun  and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thy hand. and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go but if thou wilt not go with me i will not go. and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor for jehovah will sell sisera into the hand of a woman. and deborah arose and went with barak to kedesh. and barak called zebulun and naphtali together to kedesh and there went up ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him. now heber the kenite had separated himself from the kenites even from the children of hobab the brotherinlaw of moses and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in zaanannim which is by kedesh. and they told sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor. and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river kishon.  and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which jehovah hath delivered sisera into thy hand is not jehovah gone out before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him. and jehovah discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak and sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on his feet. but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell by the edge of the sword there was not a man left. howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite.  and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my lord turn in to me fear not. and he turned in unto her into the tent and she covered him with a rug. and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty. and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him.  and he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and inquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no. then jael hebers wife took a tentpin and took a hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the pin into his temples and it pierced through into the ground for he was in a deep sleep so he swooned and died. and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him and said unto him come and i will show thee the man whom thou seekest. and he came unto her and behold sisera lay dead and the tentpin was in his temples. so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel. and the hand of the children of israel prevailed more and more against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan.  then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying for that the leaders took the lead in israel for that the people offered themselves willingly bless ye jehovah.  hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i [even] i will sing unto jehovah i will sing praise to jehovah the god of israel. jehovah when thou wentest forth out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled the heavens also dropped yea the clouds dropped water. the mountains quaked at the presence of jehovah even yon sinai at the presence of jehovah the god of israel. in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways. the rulers ceased in israel they ceased until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel. they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye jehovah.  tell [of it] ye that ride on white asses ye that sit on rich carpets and ye that walk by the way.  far from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of jehovah [even] the righteous acts of his rule in israel. then the people of jehovah went down to the gates. awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead away thy captives thou son of abinoam. then came down a remnant of the nobles [and] the people jehovah came down for me against the mighty. out of ephraim [came down] they whose root is in amalek after thee benjamin among thy peoples out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the marshals staff. and the princes of issachar were with deborah as was issachar so was barak into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. by the watercourses of reuben there were great resolves of heart. why sattest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the pipings for the flocks at the watercourses of reuben there were great searchings of heart. gilead abode beyond the jordan and dan why did he remain in ships asher sat still at the haven of the sea and abode by his creeks.  zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death and naphtali upon the high places of the field. the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan. in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money. from heaven fought the stars from their courses they fought against sisera. the river kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon. o my soul march on with strength. then did the horsehoofs stamp by reason of the prancings the prancings of their strong ones. curse ye meroz said the angel of jehovah. curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of jehovah to the help of jehovah against the mighty. blessed above women shall jael be the wife of heber the kenite blessed shall she be above women in the tent. he asked water [and] she gave him milk she brought him butter in a lordly dish. she put her hand to the tentpin and her right hand to the workmens hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote through his head yea she pierced and struck through his temples.  at her feet he bowed he fell he lay at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead. through the window she looked forth and cried the mother of sisera [cried] through the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself have they not found have they not divided the spoil a damsel two damsels to every man to sisera a spoil of dyed garments a spoil of dyed garments embroidered of dyed garments embroidered on both sides on the necks of the spoil so let all thine enemies perish o jehovah but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. and the land had rest forty years. and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and jehovah delivered them into the hand of midian seven years. and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of midian the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.  and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance in israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass. for they came up with their cattle and their tents they came in as locusts for multitude both they and their camels were without number and they came into the land to destroy it. and israel was brought very low because of midian and the children of israel cried unto jehovah. and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto jehovah because of midian that jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of israel and he said unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land  and i said unto you i am jehovah your god ye shall not fear the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell. but ye have not hearkened unto my voice. and the angel of jehovah came and sat under the oak which was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the midianites. and the angel of jehovah appeared unto him and said unto him jehovah is with thee thou mighty man of valor. and gideon said unto him oh my lord if jehovah is with us why then is all this befallen us and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of saying did not jehovah bring us up from egypt but now jehovah hath cast us off and delivered us into the hand of midian. and jehovah looked upon him and said go in this thy might and save israel from the hand of midian have not i sent thee and he said unto him oh lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is the poorest in manasseh and i am the least in my fathers house. and jehovah said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man.  and he said unto him if now i have found favor in thy sight then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me. depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and lay it before thee. and he said i will tarry until thou come again. and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it. and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth. and he did so. then the angel of jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there went up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes and the angel of jehovah departed out of his sight. and gideon saw that he was the angel of jehovah and gideon said alas o lord jehovah forasmuch as i have seen the angel of jehovah face to face. and jehovah said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die.  then gideon built an altar there unto jehovah and called it jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites. and it came to pass the same night that jehovah said unto him take thy fathers bullock even the second bullock seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the asherah that is by it and build an altar unto jehovah thy god upon the top of this stronghold in the orderly manner and take the second bullock and offer a burntoffering with the wood of the asherah which thou shalt cut down. then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as jehovah had spoken unto him and it came to pass because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city so that he could not do it by day that he did it by night. and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was broken down and the asherah was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they inquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done this thing.  then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath broken down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the asherah that was by it. and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye contend for baal or will ye save him he that will contend for him let him be put to death whilst [it is yet] morning if he be a god let him contend for himself because one hath broken down his altar. therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal contend against him because he hath broken down his altar. then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together and they passed over and encamped in the valley of jezreel. but the spirit of jehovah came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered together after him. and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh and they also were gathered together after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them. and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by my hand as thou hast spoken  behold i will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor if there be dew on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the ground then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by my hand as thou hast spoken. and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and pressed the fleece together and wrung the dew out of the fleece a bowlful of water. and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be kindled against me and i will speak but this once let me make trial i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew. and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground. then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and encamped beside the spring of harod and the camp of midian was on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley. and jehovah said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hand lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me.  now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and trembling let him return and depart from mount gilead. and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand. and jehovah said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go. so he brought down the people unto the water and jehovah said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth was three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. and jehovah said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thy hand and let all the people go every man unto his place.  so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the men of israel every man unto his tent but retained the three hundred men and the camp of midian was beneath him in the valley. and it came to pass the same night that jehovah said unto him arise get thee down into the camp for i have delivered it into thy hand. but if thou fear to go down go thou with purah thy servant down to the camp and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. then went he down with purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude.  and when gideon was come behold there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow and he said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of midian and came unto the tent and smote it so that it fell and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat. and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel into his hand god hath delivered midian and all the host. and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and he returned into the camp of israel and said arise for jehovah hath delivered into your hand the host of midian. and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets and empty pitchers with torches within the pitchers. and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outermost part of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do. when i blow the trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say for jehovah and for gideon.  so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch when they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow and they cried the sword of jehovah and of gideon. and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and they shouted and put [them] to flight. and they blew the three hundred trumpets and jehovah set every mans sword against his fellow and against all the host and the host fled as far as bethshittah toward zererah as far as the border of abel meholah by tabbath. and the men of israel were gathered together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after midian.  and gideon sent messengers throughout all the hillcountry of ephraim saying come down against midian and take before them the waters as far as beth barah even the jordan. so all the men of ephraim were gathered together and took the waters as far as beth barah even the jordan. and they took the two princes of midian oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb at the rock of oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and they brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon beyond the jordan. and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with midian and they did chide with him sharply. and he said unto them what have i now done in comparison with you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer god hath delivered into your hand the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison with you then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that. and gideon came to the jordan [and] passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing.  and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they are faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna the kings of midian. and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread unto thine army and gideon said therefore when jehovah hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into my hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them in like manner and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered. and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower. now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the host of the children of the east for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure.  and zebah and zalmunna fled and he pursued after them and he took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host. and gideon the son of joash returned from the battle from the ascent of heres. and he caught a young man of the men of succoth and inquired of him and he described for him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof seventy and seven men. and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna concerning whom ye did taunt me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth. and he brake down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city. then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king. and he said they were my brethren the sons of my mother as jehovah liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you.  and he said unto jether his first born up and slay them. but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth. then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength. and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took the crescents that were on their camels necks. then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast saved us out of the hand of midian. and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you jehovah shall rule over you. and gideon said unto them i would make a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites. and they answered we will willingly give them. and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.  and the weight of the golden ear rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold besides the crescents and the pendants and the purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and besides the chains that were about their camels necks.  and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel played the harlot after it there and it became a snare unto gideon and to his house. so midian was subdued before the children of israel and they lifted up their heads no more. and the land had rest forty years in the days of gideon. and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house. and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives. and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son and he called his name abimelech. and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites. and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and played the harlot after the baalim and made baal berith their god.  and the children of israel remembered not jehovah their god who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side neither showed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal [who is] gideon according to all the goodness which he had showed unto israel.  and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mothers brethren and spake with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father saying speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you that all the sons of jerubbaal who are threescore and ten persons rule over you or that one rule over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh. and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother. and they gave him threescore and ten [pieces] of silver out of the house of baal berith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light fellows who followed him.  and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone but jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself. and all the men of shechem assembled themselves together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in shechem. and when they told it to jotham he went and stood on the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you.  the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olivetree reign thou over us. but the olivetree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honor god and man and go to wave to and fro over the trees and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us. but the figtree said unto them should i leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go to wave to and fro over the trees and the trees said unto the vine come thou and reign over us.  and the vine said unto them should i leave my new wine which cheereth god and man and go to wave to and fro over the trees then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us. and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and take refuge in my shade and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon. now therefore if ye have dealt truly and uprightly in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands  for my father fought for you and adventured his life and delivered you out of the hand of midian and ye are risen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maid servant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you  but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech. and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother. and abimelech was prince over israel three years. and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come and that their blood might be laid upon abimelech their brother who slew them and upon the men of shechem who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren. and the men of shechem set liersinwait for him on the tops of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told abimelech. and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their trust in him.  and they went out into the field and gathered their vineyards and trod [the grapes] and held festival and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech. and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and zebul his officer serve ye the men of hamor the father of shechem but why should we serve him and would that this people were under my hand then would i remove abimelech. and he said to abimelech increase thine army and come out. and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed his anger was kindled. and he sent messengers unto abimelech craftily saying behold gaal the son of ebed and his brethren are come to shechem and behold they constrain the city [to take part] against thee. now therefore up by night thou and the people that are with thee and lie in wait in the field  and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and rush upon the city and behold when he and the people that are with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies. and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from the ambushment. and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there come people down from the tops of the mountains. and zebul said unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and one company cometh by the way of the oak of meonenim. then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth that thou saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the people that thou hast despised go out now i pray and fight with them. and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech.  and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and there fell many wounded even unto the entrance of the gate. and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul drove out gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in shechem. and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told abimelech. and he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and he looked and behold the people came forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote them. and abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field and smote them. and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that were therein and he beat down the city and sowed it with salt. and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard thereof they entered into the stronghold of the house of elberith. and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together.  and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it up and laid it on his shoulder and he said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do make haste and do as i have done. and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the stronghold and set the stronghold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also about a thousand men and women. then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it. but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut themselves in and gat them up to the roof of the tower. and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. and a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon abimelechs head and brake his skull.  then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer and said unto him draw thy sword and kill me that men say not of me a woman slew him. and his young man thrust him through and he died. and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his place. thus god requited the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren and all the wickedness of the men of shechem did god requite upon their heads and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal. and after abimelech there arose to save israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in the hill country of ephraim. and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in shamir. and after him arose jair the gileadite and he judged israel twenty and two years. and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called havvothjair unto this day which are in the land of gilead. and jair died and was buried in kamon.  and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and served the baalim and the ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the gods of sidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines and they forsook jehovah and served him not. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he sold them into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the children of ammon. and they vexed and oppressed the children of israel that year eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of israel that were beyond the jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead. and the children of ammon passed over the jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel was sore distressed. and the children of israel cried unto jehovah saying we have sinned against thee even because we have forsaken our god and have served the baalim.  and jehovah said unto the children of israel [did] not [i save you] from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines the sidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried unto me and i saved you out of their hand. yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will save you no more. go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them save you in the time of your distress. and the children of israel said unto jehovah we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee only deliver us we pray thee this day. and they put away the foreign gods from among them and served jehovah and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel. then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped in gilead. and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpah. and the people the princes of gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead.  now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valor and he was the son of a harlot and gilead begat jephthah. and gileads wife bare him sons and when his wifes sons grew up they drove out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our fathers house for thou art the son of another woman. then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain fellows to jephthah and they went out with him. and it came to pass after a while that the children of ammon made war against israel. and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob and they said unto jephthah come and be our chief that we may fight with the children of ammon. and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me and drive me out of my fathers house and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress  and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore are we turned again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight with the children of ammon and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead. and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight with the children of ammon and jehovah deliver them before me shall i be your head and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah jehovah shall be witness between us surely according to thy word so will we do. then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and chief over them and jephthah spake all his words before jehovah in mizpah. and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come unto me to fight against my land and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when he came up out of egypt from the arnon even unto the jabbok and unto the jordan now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.  and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon and he said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon but when they came up from egypt and israel went through the wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee pass through thy land but the king of edom hearkened not. and in like manner he sent unto the king of moab but he would not and israel abode in kadesh. then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and they encamped on the other side of the arnon but they came not within the border of moab for the arnon was the border of moab. and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land unto my place. but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and encamped in jahaz and fought against israel.  and jehovah the god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country. and they possessed all the border of the amorites from the arnon even unto the jabbok and from the wilderness even unto the jordan. so now jehovah the god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess them wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoever jehovah our god hath dispossessed from before us them will we possess. and now art thou anything better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them while israel dwelt in heshbon and its towns and in aroer and its towns and in all the cities that are along by the side of the arnon three hundred years wherefore did ye not recover them within that time i therefore have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me jehovah the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon.  howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him. then the spirit of jehovah came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon. and jephthah vowed a vow unto jehovah and said if thou wilt indeed deliver the children of ammon into my hand then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon it shall be jehovahs and i will offer it up for a burnt offering. so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and jehovah delivered them into his hand. and he smote them from aroer until thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto abelcheramim with a very great slaughter. so the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel. and jephthah came to mizpah unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child besides her he had neither son nor daughter.  and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto jehovah and i cannot go back. and she said unto him my father thou hast opened thy mouth unto jehovah do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies even on the children of ammon. and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may depart and go down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my companions. and he said go. and he sent her away for two months and she departed she and her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew not man. and it was a custom in israel that the daughters of israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year.  and the men of ephraim were gathered together and passed northward and they said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thy house upon thee with fire. and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye saved me not out of their hand. and when i saw that ye saved me not i put my life in my hand and passed over against the children of ammon and jehovah delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye are fugitives of ephraim ye gileadites in the midst of ephraim [and] in the midst of manasseh. and the gileadites took the fords of the jordan against the ephraimites. and it was so that when [any of] the fugitives of ephraim said let me go over the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay  then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they laid hold on him and slew him at the fords of the jordan. and there fell at that time of ephraim forty and two thousand. and jephthah judged israel six years. then died jephthah the gileadite and was buried in [one of] the cities of gilead. and after him ibzan of beth lehem judged israel. and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters he sent abroad and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. and he judged israel seven years. and ibzan died and was buried at bethlehem. and after him elon the zebulunite judged israel and he judged israel ten years.  and elon the zebulunite died and was buried in aijalon in the land of zebulun. and after him abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite judged israel. and he had forty sons and thirty sons sons that rode on threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years. and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the hillcountry of the amalekites.  and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and jehovah delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years. and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not. and the angel of jehovah appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son. now therefore beware i pray thee and drink no wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a nazirite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to save israel out of the hand of the philistines.  then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of god very terrible and i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name  but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazirite unto god from the womb to the day of his death. then manoah entreated jehovah and said oh lord i pray thee let the man of god whom thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her. and the woman made haste and ran and told her husband and said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the [other] day. and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and he said i am. and manoah said now let thy words come to pass what shall be the ordering of the child and [how] shall we do unto him  and the angel of jehovah said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her beware.  she may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe. and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah i pray thee let us detain thee that we may make ready a kid for thee. and the angel of jehovah said unto manoah though thou detain me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt make ready a burntoffering thou must offer it unto jehovah. for manoah knew not that he was the angel of jehovah. and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah what is thy name that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honor and the angel of jehovah said unto him wherefore askest thou after my name seeing it is wonderful so manoah took the kid with the mealoffering and offered it upon the rock unto jehovah and [the angel] did wondrously and manoah and his wife looked on. for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar and manoah and his wife looked on and they fell on their faces to the ground.  but the angel of jehovah did no more appear to manoah or to his wife. then manoah knew that he was the angel of jehovah. and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god. but his wife said unto him if jehovah were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burntoffering and a mealoffering at our hand neither would he have showed us all these things nor would at this time have told such things as these. and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and jehovah blessed him. and the spirit of jehovah began to move him in mahanehdan between zorah and eshtaol. and samson went down to timnah and saw a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines. and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines now therefore get her for me to wife. then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well.  but his father and his mother knew not that it was of jehovah for he sought an occasion against the philistines. now at that time the philistines had rule over israel. then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnah and came to the vineyards of timnah and behold a young lion roared against him. and the spirit of jehovah came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased samson well. and after a while he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion and honey. and he took it into his hands and went on eating as he went and he came to his father and mother and gave unto them and they did eat but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion. and his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do. and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him.  and samson said unto them let me now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment but if ye cannot declare it unto me then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it. and he said unto them out of the eater came forth food and out of the strong came forth sweetness. and they could not in three days declare the riddle. and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samsons wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have ye called us to impoverish us is it not [so] and samsons wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me. and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell thee  and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she pressed him sore and she told the riddle to the children of her people. and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle. and the spirit of jehovah came mightily upon him and he went down to ashkelon and smote thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave the changes [of raiment] unto them that declared the riddle. and his anger was kindled and he went up to his fathers house. but samsons wife was [given] to his companion whom he had used as his friend. but it came to pass after a while in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber. but her father would not suffer him to go in.  and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her. and samson said unto them this time shall i be blameless in regard of the philistines when i do them a mischief. and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails. and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing grain of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain and also the oliveyards. then the philistines said who hath done this and they said samson the soninlaw of the timnite because he hath taken his wife and given her to his companion. and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire. and samson said unto them if ye do after this manner surely i will be avenged of you and after that i will cease. and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of etam.  then the philistines went up and encamped in judah and spread themselves in lehi. and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and they said to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us. then three thousand men of judah went down to the cleft of the rock of etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us what then is this that thou hast done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them. and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines. and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee. and they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted as they met him and the spirit of jehovah came mightily upon him and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands dropped from off his hands.  and he found a fresh jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and smote a thousand men therewith. and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jawbone of an ass have i smitten a thousand men. and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and that place was called ramath lehi. and he was sore athirst and called on jehovah and said thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised. but god clave the hollow place that is in lehi and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore the name thereof was called en hakkore which is in lehi unto this day. and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years. and samson went to gaza and saw there a harlot and went in unto her.  [and it was told] the gazites saying samson is come hither. and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying [let be] till morning light then we will kill him. and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and plucked them up bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before hebron. and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah. and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred [pieces] of silver. and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried then shall i become weak and be as another man.  then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried and she bound him with them. now she had liersinwait abiding in the inner chamber. and she said unto him the philistines are upon thee samson. and he brake the withes as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. so his strength was not known. and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound. and he said unto her if they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done then shall i become weak and be as another man. so delilah took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the philistines are upon thee samson. and the liersinwait were abiding in the inner chamber. and he brake them off his arms like a thread. and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. and he said unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.  and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the philistines are upon thee samson. and he awaked out of his sleep and plucked away the pin of the beam and the web. and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thy heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him that his soul was vexed unto death. and he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon my head for i have been a nazirite unto god from my mothers womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man. and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath told me all his heart. then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought the money in their hand. and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him.  and she said the philistines are upon thee samson. and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times and shake myself free. but he knew not that jehovah was departed from him. and the philistines laid hold on him and put out his eyes and they brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prisonhouse. howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. and the lords of the philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand. and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy and the destroyer of our country who hath slain many of us. and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for samson that he may make us sport. and they called for samson out of the prisonhouse and he made sport before them. and they set him between the pillars  and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth that i may lean upon them. now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport. and samson called unto jehovah and said o lord jehovah remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes. and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested and leaned upon them the one with his right hand and the other with his left. and samson said let me die with the philistines. and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein. so the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life. then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father. and he judged israel twenty years.  and there was a man of the hill country of ephraim whose name was micah. and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver that were taken from thee about which thou didst utter a curse and didst also speak it in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it. and his mother said blessed be my son of jehovah. and he restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother and his mother said i verily dedicate the silver unto jehovah from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee. and when he restored the money unto his mother his mother took two hundred [pieces] of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and it was in the house of micah. and the man micah had a house of gods and he made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest. in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes. and there was a young man out of bethlehem judah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there.  and the man departed out of the city out of bethlehem judah to sojourn where he could find [a place] and he came to the hillcountry of ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed. and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehem judah and i go to sojourn where i may find [a place]. and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten [pieces] of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals. so the levite went in. and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah. then said micah now know i that jehovah will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest. in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day [their] inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel.  and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their whole number men of valor from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land. and they came to the hillcountry of ephraim unto the house of micah and lodged there. when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned aside thither and said unto him who brought thee hither and what doest thou in this place and what hast thou here and he said unto them thus and thus hath micah dealt with me and he hath hired me and i am become his priest. and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. and the priest said unto them go in peace before jehovah is your way wherein ye go. then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt in security after the manner of the sidonians quiet and secure for there was none in the land possessing authority that might put [them] to shame in anything and they were far from the sidonians and had no dealings with any man.  and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what [say] ye and they said arise and let us go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and the land is large for god hath given it into your hand a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth. and there set forth from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men girt with weapons of war. and they went up and encamped in kiriathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahaneh dan unto this day behold it is behind kiriath jearim. and they passed thence unto the hillcountry of ephraim and came unto the house of micah. then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to do.  and they turned aside thither and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and asked him of his welfare.  and the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war who were of the children of dan stood by the entrance of the gate. and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war. and when these went into micahs house and fetched the graven image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image the priest said unto them what do ye and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in israel and the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people.  so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micahs house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan.  and they cried unto the children of dan. and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and are gone away and what have i more and how then say ye unto me what aileth thee and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows fall upon you and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household. and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house. and they took that which micah had made and the priest whom he had and came unto laish unto a people quiet and secure and smote them with the edge of the sword and they burnt the city with fire.  and there was no deliverer because it was far from sidon and they had no dealings with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by beth rehob. and they built the city and dwelt therein. and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first.  and the children of dan set up for themselves the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of moses he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the danites until the day of the captivity of the land. so they set them up micahs graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh. and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehem judah. and his concubine played the harlot against him and went away from him unto her fathers house to beth lehemjudah and was there the space of four months.  and her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly unto her to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him. and his fatherin law the damsels father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there. and it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning and he rose up to depart and the damsels father said unto his son inlaw strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread and afterward ye shall go your way. so they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together and the damsels father said unto the man be pleased i pray thee to tarry all night and let thy heart be merry. and the man rose up to depart but his fatherinlaw urged him and he lodged there again. and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsels father said strengthen thy heart i pray thee and tarry ye until the day declineth and they did eat both of them.  and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his fatherinlaw the damsels father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thy heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home. but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus the same is jerusalem and there were with him a couple of asses saddled his concubine also was with him. when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn aside into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it. and his master said unto him we will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of israel but we will pass over to gibeah. and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one of these places and we will lodge in gibeah or in ramah. so they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them near to gibeah which belongeth to benjamin.  and they turned aside thither to go in to lodge in gibeah and he went in and sat him down in the street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge. and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even now the man was of the hillcountry of ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites. and he lifted up his eyes and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and whence comest thou and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehem judah unto the farther side of the hillcountry of ephraim from thence am i and i went to beth lehemjudah and i am [now] going to the house of jehovah and there is no man that taketh me into his house. yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man that is with thy servants there is no want of anything. and the old man said peace be unto thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street.  so he brought him into his house and gave the asses fodder and they washed their feet and did eat and drink. as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain base fellows beset the house round about beating at the door and they spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thy house that we may know him. and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them nay my brethren i pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into my house do not this folly. behold here is my daughter a virgin and his concubine them i will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not any such folly. but the men would not hearken to him so the man laid hold on his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go. then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the mans house where her lord was till it was light.  and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house with her hands upon the threshold. and he said unto her up and let us be going but none answered then he took her up upon the ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place. and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her limb by limb into twelve pieces and sent her throughout all the borders of israel. and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day consider it take counsel and speak. then all the children of israel went out and the congregation was assembled as one man from dan even to beersheba with the land of gilead unto jehovah at mizpah. and the chiefs of all the people even of all the tribes of israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.  now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpah. and the children of israel said tell us how was this wickedness brought to pass and the levite the husband of the woman that was murdered answered and said i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge. and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about me by night me they thought to have slain and my concubine they forced and she is dead. and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel. behold ye children of israel all of you give here your advice and counsel. and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn unto his house. but now this is the thing which we will do to gibeah [we will go up] against it by lot  and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and a hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victuals for the people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel. so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man. and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is come to pass among you now therefore deliver up the men the base fellows that are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel. but benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel. and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of israel. and the children of benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword besides the inhabitants of gibeah who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.  among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at a hairbreadth and not miss. and the men of israel besides benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war. and the children of israel arose and went up to bethel and asked counsel of god and they said who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of benjamin and jehovah said judah [shall go up] first. and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped against gibeah. and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and the men of israel set the battle in array against them at gibeah. and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men. and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.  and the children of israel went up and wept before jehovah until even and they asked of jehovah saying shall i again draw nigh to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and jehovah said go up against him. and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day. and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword. then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto bethel and wept and sat there before jehovah and fasted that day until even and they offered burntofferings and peace offerings before jehovah. and the children of israel asked of jehovah for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and jehovah said go up for tomorrow i will deliver him into thy hand.  and israel set liersinwait against gibeah round about. and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against gibeah as at other times. and the children of benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite and kill of the people as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to bethel and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty men of israel. and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before us as at the first. but the children of israel said let us flee and draw them away from the city unto the highways. and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at baal tamar and the liersinwait of israel brake forth out of their place even out of maarehgeba. and there came over against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was close upon them. and jehovah smote benjamin before israel and the children of israel destroyed of benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men all these drew the sword.  so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of israel gave place to benjamin because they trusted unto the liersinwait whom they had set against gibeah. and the liersin wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the liersinwait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. now the appointed sign between the men of israel and the liersinwait was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. and the men of israel turned in the battle and benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle. but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the whole of the city went up [in smoke] to heaven. and the men of israel turned and the men of benjamin were dismayed for they saw that evil was come upon them.  therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle followed hard after them and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof. they inclosed the benjamites round about [and] chased them [and] trod them down at [their] restingplace as far as over against gibeah toward the sunrising. and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these [were] men of valor. and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and followed hard after them unto gidom and smote of them two thousand men. so that all who fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these [were] men of valor. but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and abode in the rock of rimmon four months.  and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword both the entire city and the cattle and all that they found moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire. now the men of israel had sworn in mizpah saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife. and the people came to bethel and sat there till even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore. and they said o jehovah the god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that there should be today one tribe lacking in israel and it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burntofferings and peace offerings. and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up in the assembly unto jehovah for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto jehovah to mizpah saying he shall surely be put to death. and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day.  how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up unto jehovah to mizpah and behold there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly. for when the people were numbered behold there were none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there. and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the little ones. and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man. and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had not known man by lying with him and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of canaan. and the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of benjamin that were in the rock of rimmon and proclaimed peace unto them.  and benjamin returned at that time and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not. and the people repented them for benjamin because that jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of israel. then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin and they said there must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not blotted out from israel. howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of israel had sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin. and they said behold there is a feast of jehovah from year to year in shiloh which is on the north of bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the south of lebonah. and they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards  and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in the dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin. and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us that we will say unto them grant them graciously unto us because we took not for each man [of them] his wife in battle neither did ye give them unto them else would ye now be guilty. and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they carried off and they went and returned unto their inheritance and built the cities and dwelt in them. and the children of israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes. and it came to pass in the days when the judges judged that there was a famine in the land. and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons.  and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of bethlehemjudah. and they came into the country of moab and continued there. and elimelech naomis husband died and she was left and her two sons. and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelt there about ten years. and mahlon and chilion died both of them and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband. then she arose with her daughtersinlaw that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread. and she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughtersinlaw with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah. and naomi said unto her two daughtersinlaw go return each of you to her mothers house jehovah deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me.  jehovah grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband. then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept. and they said unto her nay but we will return with thee unto thy people. and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me have i yet sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband. if i should say i have hope if i should even have a husband to night and should also bear sons would ye therefore tarry till they were grown would ye therefore stay from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes for the hand of jehovah is gone forth against me. and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her motherinlaw but ruth clave unto her. and she said behold thy sisterinlaw is gone back unto her people and unto her god return thou after thy sisterinlaw. and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee and to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god  where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried jehovah do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me. and when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her she left off speaking unto her. so they two went until they came to bethlehem. and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and [the women] said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. i went out full and jehovah hath brought me home again empty why call ye me naomi seeing jehovah hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughterinlaw with her who returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. and naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz.  and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight i shall find favor. and she said unto her go my daughter.  and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the family of elimelech. and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers jehovah be with you. and they answered him jehovah bless thee. then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said let me glean i pray you and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now save that she tarried a little in the house. then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither pass from hence but abide here fast by my maidens.  let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn. then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found favor in thy sight that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a foreigner and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy motherinlaw since the death of thy husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore. jehovah recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of jehovah the god of israel under whose wings thou art come to take refuge. then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid though i be not as one of thy handmaidens.  and at mealtime boaz said unto her come hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. and she sat beside the reapers and they reached her parched grain and she did eat and was sufficed and left thereof. and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not. and also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave it and let her glean and rebuke her not. so she gleaned in the field until even and she beat out that which she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley. and she took it up and went into the city and her motherinlaw saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed. and her mother inlaw said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day and where hast thou wrought blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. and she showed her motherinlaw with whom she had wrought and said the mans name with whom i wrought today is boaz.  and naomi said unto her daughterinlaw blessed be he of jehovah who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. and naomi said unto her the man is nigh of kin unto us one of our near kinsmen. and ruth the moabitess said yea he said unto me thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest. and naomi said unto ruth her daughterinlaw it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens and that they meet thee not in any other field. so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and she dwelt with her motherinlaw. and naomi her motherinlaw said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz our kinsman with whose maidens thou wast behold he winnoweth barley tonight in the threshingfloor. wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the threshing floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking.  and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. and she said unto her all that thou sayest i will do. and she went down unto the threshingfloor and did according to all that her motherinlaw bade her. and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down. and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet. and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art a near kinsman. and he said blessed be thou of jehovah my daughter thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich. and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou sayest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.  and now it is true that i am a near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i. tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as jehovah liveth lie down until the morning. and she lay at his feet until the morning. and she rose up before one could discern another. for he said let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. and he said bring the mantle that is upon thee and hold it and she held it and he measured six [measures] of barley and laid it on her and he went into the city. and when she came to her motherinlaw she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her. and she said these six [measures] of barley gave he me for he said go not empty unto thy mother inlaw. then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not rest until he have finished the thing this day.  now boaz went up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the near kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here. and he turned aside and sat down. and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here. and they sat down. and he said unto the near kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth the parcel of land which was our brother elimelechs and i thought to disclose it unto thee saying buy it before them that sit here and before the elders of my people. if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it besides thee and i am after thee. and he said i will redeem it. then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. and the near kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance take thou my right of redemption on thee for i cannot redeem it.  now this was [the custom] in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging to confirm all things a man drew off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was the [manner of] attestation in israel. so the near kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thyself. and he drew off his shoe. and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs and all that was chilions and mahlons of the hand of naomi. moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day. and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses. jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephrathah and be famous in bethlehem  and let thy house be like the house of perez whom tamar bare unto judah of the seed which jehovah shall give thee of this young woman. so boaz took ruth and she became his wife and he went in unto her and jehovah gave her conception and she bare a son. and the women said unto naomi blessed be jehovah who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman and let his name be famous in israel. and he shall be unto thee a restorer of life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter inlaw who loveth thee who is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him. and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it. and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david. now these are the generations of perez perez begat hezron and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon and salmon begat boaz and boaz begat obed and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david.  now there was a certain man of ramathaim zophim of the hillcountry of ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephraimite and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children. and this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto jehovah of hosts in shiloh. and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas priests unto jehovah were there. and when the day came that elkanah sacrificed he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto hannah he gave a double portion for he loved hannah but jehovah had shut up her womb. and her rival provoked her sore to make her fret because jehovah had shut up her womb. and [as] he did so year by year when she went up to the house of jehovah so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat. and elkanah her husband said unto her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons  so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk. now eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door post of the temple of jehovah. and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto jehovah and wept sore. and she vowed a vow and said o jehovah of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child then i will give him unto jehovah all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head. and it came to pass as she continued praying before jehovah that eli marked her mouth. now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken. and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee. and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but i poured out my soul before jehovah. count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have i spoken hitherto.  then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him. and she said let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more [sad]. and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before jehovah and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and jehovah remembered her. and it came to pass when the time was come about that hannah conceived and bare a son and she called his name samuel [saying] because i have asked him of jehovah. and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow. but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband [i will not go up] until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before jehovah and there abide for ever. and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only jehovah establish his word. so the woman tarried and gave her son suck until she weaned him.  and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of meal and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of jehovah in shiloh and the child was young. and they slew the bullock and brought the child to eli. and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto jehovah. for this child i prayed and jehovah hath given me my petition which i asked of him therefore also i have granted him to jehovah as long as he liveth he is granted to jehovah. and he worshipped jehovah there. and hannah prayed and said my heart exulteth in jehovah my horn is exalted in jehovah my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation. there is none holy as jehovah for there is none besides thee neither is there any rock like our god. talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for jehovah is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed. the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength.  they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry have ceased [to hunger] yea the barren hath borne seven and she that hath many children languisheth. jehovah killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to sheol and bringeth up. jehovah maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low he also lifteth up. he raiseth up the poor out of the dust he lifteth up the needy from the dunghill to make them sit with princes and inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are jehovahs and he hath set the world upon them. he will keep the feet of his holy ones but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail. they that strive with jehovah shall be broken to pieces against them will he thunder in heaven jehovah will judge the ends of the earth and he will give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed. and elkanah went to ramah to his house. and the child did minister unto jehovah before eli the priest. now the sons of eli were base men they knew not jehovah.  and the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was boiling with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith. so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither. yea before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have boiled flesh of thee but raw. and if the man said unto him they will surely burn the fat first and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would say nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force. and the sin of the young men was very great before jehovah for the men despised the offering of jehovah. but samuel ministered before jehovah being a child girded with a linen ephod. moreover his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of jehovah. and they went unto their own home. and jehovah visited hannah and she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters. and the child samuel grew before jehovah. now eli was very old and he heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings from all this people. nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make jehovahs people to transgress. if one man sin against another god shall judge him but if a man sin against jehovah who shall entreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because jehovah was minded to slay them. and the child samuel grew on and increased in favor both with jehovah and also with men. and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith jehovah did i reveal myself unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt [in bondage] to pharaohs house  and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to go up unto mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of israel made by fire wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in [my] habitation and honorest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people therefore jehovah the god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now jehovah saith be it far from me for them that honor me i will honor and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thy house. and thou shalt behold the affliction of [my] habitation in all the wealth which [god] shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.  and the man of thine [whom] i shall not cut off from mine altar [shall be] to consume thine eyes and to grieve thy heart and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age. and this shall be the sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them. and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a morsel of bread.  and the child samuel ministered unto jehovah before eli. and the word of jehovah was precious in those days there was no frequent vision. and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place now his eyes had begun to wax dim so that he could not see and the lamp of god was not yet gone out and samuel was laid down [to sleep] in the temple of jehovah where the ark of god was  that jehovah called samuel and he said here am i. and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me. and he said i called not lie down again. and he went and lay down. and jehovah called yet again samuel. and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou calledst me. and he answered i called not my son lie down again. now samuel did not yet know jehovah neither was the word of jehovah yet revealed unto him. and jehovah called samuel again the third time. and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou calledst me. and eli perceived that jehovah had called the child.  therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak jehovah for thy servant heareth. so samuel went and lay down in his place. and jehovah came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel. then samuel said speak for thy servant heareth. and jehovah said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.  in that day i will perform against eli all that i have spoken concerning his house from the beginning even unto the end. for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knew because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves and he restrained them not. and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of elis house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of jehovah. and samuel feared to show eli the vision. then eli called samuel and said samuel my son. and he said here am i. and he said what is the thing that [jehovah] hath spoken unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.  and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him. and he said it is jehovah let him do what seemeth him good. and samuel grew and jehovah was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground. and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of jehovah.  and jehovah appeared again in shiloh for jehovah revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of jehovah. and the word of samuel came to all israel. now israel went out against the philistines to battle and encamped beside ebenezer and the philistines encamped in aphek. and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath jehovah smitten us today before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of jehovah out of shiloh unto us that it may come among us and save us out of the hand of our enemies. so the people sent to shiloh and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of jehovah of hosts who sitteth [above] the cherubim and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god. and when the ark of the covenant of jehovah came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again.  and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of jehovah was come into the camp. and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp. and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness. be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight. and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man to his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen. and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain. and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.  and when he came lo eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god. and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out. and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man hasted and came and told eli. now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see. and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled today out of the army. and he said how went the matter my son and he that brought the tidings answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken. and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that [eli] feel from off his seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy. and he had judged israel forty years.  and his daughter inlaw phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her fatherin law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and brought forth for her pains came upon her. and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast brought forth a son. but she answered not neither did she regard it. and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her fatherinlaw and her husband. and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken. now the philistines had taken the ark of god and they brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod. and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon. and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of jehovah. and they took dagon and set him in his place again.  and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of jehovah and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off upon the threshold only [the stump of] dagon was left to him. therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day. but the hand of jehovah was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with tumors even ashdod and the borders thereof. and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god. they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath. and they carried the ark of the god of israel [thither].  and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture and he smote the men of the city both small and great and tumors brake out upon them. so they sent the ark of god to ekron. and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people. they sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and they said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to its own place that is slay us not and our people. for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there. and the men that died not were smitten with the tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven. and the ark of jehovah was in the country of the philistines seven months. and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do with the ark of jehovah show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place.  and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but by all means return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. then said they what shall be the trespassoffering which we shall return to him and they said five golden tumors and five golden mice [according to] the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords. wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land. wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed now therefore take and prepare you a new cart and two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them  and take the ark of jehovah and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespassoffering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go. and see if it goeth up by the way of its own border to beth shemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us. and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home and they put the ark of jehovah upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors. and the kine took the straight way by the way to bethshemesh they went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh. and they of beth shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it.  and the cart came into the field of joshua the bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered up the kine for a burntoffering unto jehovah. and the levites took down the ark of jehovah and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of beth shemesh offered burntofferings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto jehovah. and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day. and these are the golden tumors which the philistines returned for a trespassoffering unto jehovah for ashdod one for gaza one for ashkelon one for gath one for ekron one and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fortified cities and of country villages even unto the great stone whereon they set down the ark of jehovah [which stone remaineth] unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite.  and he smote of the men of beth shemesh because they had looked into the ark of jehovah he smote of the people seventy men [and] fifty thousand men and the people mourned because jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter. and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before jehovah this holy god and to whom shall he go up from us and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kiriathjearim saying the philistines have brought back the ark of jehovah come ye down and fetch it up to you. and the men of kiriathjearim came and fetched up the ark of jehovah and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of jehovah. and it came to pass from the day that the ark abode in kiriath jearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after jehovah. and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto jehovah with all your heart then put away the foreign gods and the ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts unto jehovah and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines.  then the children of israel did put away the baalim and the ashtaroth and served jehovah only. and samuel said gather all israel to mizpah and i will pray for you unto jehovah. and they gathered together to mizpah and drew water and poured it out before jehovah and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against jehovah. and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpah. and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpah the lords of the philistines went up against israel. and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines. and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto jehovah our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines. and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a whole burnt offering unto jehovah and samuel cried unto jehovah for israel and jehovah answered him. and as samuel was offering up the burntoffering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten down before israel.  and the men of israel went out of mizpah and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar. then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpah and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath jehovah helped us. so the philistines were subdued and they came no more within the border of israel and the hand of jehovah was against the philistines all the days of samuel. and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the border thereof did israel deliver out of the hand of the philistines. and there was peace between israel and the amorites. and samuel judged israel all the days of his life. and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpah and he judged israel in all those places. and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and he built there an altar unto jehovah. and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel. now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abijah they were judges in beersheba.  and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted justice. then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah and they said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us. and samuel prayed unto jehovah. and jehovah said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not be king over them. according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day in that they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee. now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. and samuel told all the words of jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.  and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them unto him for his chariots and to be his horsemen and they shall run before his chariots and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties and [he will set some] to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots. and he will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers. and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants. and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants. and he will take your men servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work. he will take the tenth of your flocks and ye shall be his servants. and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you and jehovah will not answer you in that day.  but the people refused to hearken unto the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of jehovah. and jehovah said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king. and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city. now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of becorath the son of aphiah the son of a benjamite a mighty man of valor. and he had a son whose name was saul a young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. and the asses of kish sauls father were lost. and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses.  and he passed through the hill country of ephraim and passed through the land of shalishah but they found them not then they passed through the land of shaalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not. when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave off caring for the asses and be anxious for us. and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is a man that is held in honor all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go. then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way.  beforetime in israel when a man went to inquire of god thus he said come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer. then said saul to his servant well said come let us go. so they went unto the city where the man of god was. as they went up the ascent to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here and they answered them and said he is behold [he is] before thee make haste now for he is come to day into the city for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place as soon as ye are come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he goeth up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice [and] afterwards they eat that are bidden. now therefore get you up for at this time ye shall find him. and they went up to the city [and] as they came within the city behold samuel came out toward them to go up to the high place. now jehovah had revealed unto samuel a day before saul came saying  tomorrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people israel and he shall save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me.  and when samuel saw saul jehovah said unto him behold the man of whom i spake to thee this same shall have authority over my people. then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seers house is. and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me today and in the morning i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thy heart. and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not they mind on them for they are found. and for whom is all that is desirable in israel is it not for thee and for all thy fathers house and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner  and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the guest chamber and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden who were about thirty persons.  and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee. and the cook took up the thigh and that which was upon it and set it before saul. and [samuel] said behold that which hath been reserved set it before thee and eat because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee for i said i have invited the people. so saul did eat with samuel that day. and when they were come down from the high place into the city he communed with saul upon the housetop. and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called to saul on the housetop saying up that i may send thee away. and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad. as they were going down at the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still first that i may cause thee to hear the word of god.  then samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not that jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance when thou art departed from me today then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left off caring for the asses and is anxious for you saying what shall i do for my son  then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the oak of tabor and there shall meet thee there three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hand. after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a timbrel and a pipe and a harp before them and they will be prophesying  and the spirit of jehovah will come mightily upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man. and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion shall serve thee for god is with thee. and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burntofferings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peaceofferings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come unto thee and show thee what thou shalt do. and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day. and when they came thither to the hill behold a band of prophets met him and the spirit of god came mightily upon him and he prophesied among them. and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied with the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets and one of the same place answered and said and who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets  and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place. and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were not found we came to samuel. and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you. and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found. but concerning the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not. and samuel called the people together unto jehovah to mizpah and he said unto the children of israel thus saith jehovah the god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you but ye have this day rejected your god who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses and ye have said unto him [nay] but set a king over us. now therefore present yourselves before jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands. so samuel brought all the tribes of israel near and the tribe of benjamin was taken.  and he brought the tribe of benjamin near by their families and the family of the matrites was taken and saul the son of kish was taken but when they sought him he could not be found. therefore they asked of jehovah further is there yet a man to come hither and jehovah answered behold he hath hid himself among the baggage. and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom jehovah hath chosen that there is none like him along all the people and all the people shouted and said [long] live the king. then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before jehovah. and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house. and saul also went to his house to gibeah and there went with him the host whose hearts god had touched. but certain worthless fellows said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought him no present. but he held his peace.  then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabesh gilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee. and nahash the ammonite said unto them on this condition will i make it with you that all your right eyes be put out and i will lay it for a reproach upon all israel. and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the borders of israel and then if there be none to save us we will come out to thee. then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and spake these words in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voice and wept. and behold saul came following the oxen out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the words of the men of jabesh. and the spirit of god came mightily upon saul when he heard those words and his anger was kindled greatly.  and he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the borders of israel by the hand of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen. and the dread of jehovah fell on the people and they came out as one man. and he numbered them in bezek and the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand. and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabesh gilead to morrow by the time the sun is hot ye shall have deliverance. and the messengers came and told the men of jabesh and they were glad. therefore the men of jabesh said tomorrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and smote the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they that remained were scattered so that not two of them were left together.  and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death. and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for today jehovah hath wrought deliverance in israel. then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there. and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before jehovah in gilgal and there they offered sacrifices of peaceofferings before jehovah and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly. and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you. and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my youth unto this day.  here i am witness against me before jehovah and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you. and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken aught of any mans hand. and he said unto them jehovah is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found aught in my hand. and they said he is witness. and samuel said unto the people it is jehovah that appointed moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt. now therefore stand still that i may plead with you before jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of jehovah which he did to you and to your fathers. when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto jehovah then jehovah sent moses and aaron who brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them to dwell in this place.  but they forgat jehovah their god and he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them. and they cried unto jehovah and said we have sinned because we have forsaken jehovah and have served the baalim and the ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee. and jehovah sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelt in safety. and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when jehovah your god was your king. now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have asked for and behold jehovah hath set a king over you. if ye will fear jehovah and serve him and hearken unto his voice and not rebel against the commandment of jehovah and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of jehovah your god [well]  but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of jehovah but rebel against the commandment of jehovah then will the hand of jehovah be against you as it was against your fathers. now therefore stand still and see this great thing which jehovah will do before your eyes. is it not wheat harvest today i will call unto jehovah that he may send thunder and rain and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of jehovah in asking you a king. so samuel called unto jehovah and jehovah sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared jehovah and samuel. and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto jehovah thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins [this] evil to ask us a king. and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have indeed done all this evil yet turn not aside from following jehovah but serve jehovah with all your heart and turn ye not aside for [then would ye go] after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain.  for jehovah will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased jehovah to make you a people unto himself. moreover as for me far be it from me that i should sin against jehovah in ceasing to pray for you but i will instruct you in the good and the right way. only fear jehovah and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you. but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king. saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign and when he had reigned two years over israel saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in the mount of bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it. and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear.  and all israel heard say that saul had smitten the garrison of the philistines and also that israel was had in abomination with the philistines. and the people were gathered together after saul to gilgal. and the philistines assembled themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude and they came up and encamped in michmash eastward of beth aven. when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in coverts and in pits. now some of the hebrews had gone over the jordan to the land of gad and gilead but as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling. and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel [had appointed] but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him. and saul said bring hither the burntoffering to me and the peaceofferings. and he offered the burntoffering.  and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him. and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines assembled themselves together at michmash therefore said i now will the philistines come down upon me to gilgal and i have not entreated the favor of jehovah i forced myself therefore and offered the burnt offering. and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of jehovah thy god which he commanded thee for now would jehovah have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever. but now thy kingdom shall not continue jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart and jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people because thou hast not kept that which jehovah commanded thee.  and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin. and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men. and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in geba of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash. and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual and another company turned the way to beth horon and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness. now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to set the goads.  so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found. and the garrison of the philistines went out unto the pass of michmash. now it fell upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armor come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on yonder side. but he told not his father. and saul abode in the uttermost part of gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men and ahijah the son of ahitub ichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the priest of jehovah in shiloh wearing an ephod. and the people knew not that jonathan was gone. and between the passes by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh.  the one crag rose up on the north in front of michmash and the other on the south in front of geba. and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that jehovah will work for us for there is no restraint to jehovah to save by many or by few. and his armorbearer said unto him do all that is in thy heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart. then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto the men and we will disclose ourselves unto them. if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them. but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for jehovah hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be the sign unto us. and both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.  and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armorbearer and said come up to us and we will show you a thing. and jonathan said unto his armorbearer come up after me for jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of israel. and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armorbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armorbearer slew them after him. and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within as it were half a furrows length in an acre of land. and there was a trembling in the camp in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so there was an exceeding great trembling. and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went [hither] and thither. then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us. and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.  and saul said unto ahijah bring hither the ark of god. for the ark of god was [there] at that time with the children of israel. and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the tumult that was in the camp of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thy hand. and saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together and came to the battle and behold every mans sword was against his fellow [and there was] a very great discomfiture. now the hebrews that were with the philistines as beforetime and that went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about even they also [turned] to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan. likewise all the men of israel that had hid themselves in the hillcountry of ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle. so jehovah saved israel that day and the battle passed over by beth aven.  and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening and i be avenged on mine enemies. so none of the people tasted food. and all the people came into the forest and there was honey upon the ground. and when the people were come unto the forest behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath. but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened. then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth food this day. and the people were faint. then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey.  how much more if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found for now hath there been no great slaughter among the philistines.  and they smote of the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon. and the people were very faint and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood. then they told saul saying behold the people sin against jehovah in that they eat with the blood. and he said ye have dealt treacherously roll a great stone unto me this day. and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against jehovah in eating with the blood. and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there. and saul built an altar unto jehovah the same was the first altar that he built unto jehovah.  and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them. and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god.  and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day. and saul said draw nigh hither all ye chiefs of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. for as jehovah liveth who saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die. but there was not a man among all the people that answered him. then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side. and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee. therefore saul said unto jehovah the god of israel show the right. and jonathan and saul were taken [by lot] but the people escaped. and saul said cast [lots] between me and jonathan my son. and jonathan was taken.  then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done. and jonathan told him and said i did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand and lo i must die. and saul said god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan. and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel far from it as jehovah liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day. so the people rescued jonathan that he died not. then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place. now when saul had taken the kingdom over israel he fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he put [them] to the worse. and he did valiantly and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.  now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishvi and malchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the first born merab and the name of the younger michal and the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz. and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle. and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel. and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man he took him unto him. and samuel said unto saul jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of jehovah. thus saith jehovah of hosts i have marked that which amalek did to israel how he set himself against him in the way when he came up out of egypt. now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass.  and saul summoned the people and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah. and saul came to the city of amalek and laid wait in the valley. and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye showed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt. so the kenites departed from among the amalekites. and saul smote the amalekites from havilah as thou goest to shur that is before egypt. and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly. then came the word of jehovah unto samuel saying it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments. and samuel was wroth and he cried unto jehovah all night.  and samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning and it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a monument and turned and passed on and went down to gilgal. and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of jehovah i have performed the commandment of jehovah. and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto jehovah thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed. then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what jehovah hath said to me this night. and he said unto him say on. and samuel said though thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and jehovah anointed thee king over israel and jehovah sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed.  wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of jehovah but didst fly upon the spoil and didst that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of jehovah and have gone the way which jehovah sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites. but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the devoted things to sacrifice unto jehovah thy god in gilgal. and samuel said hath jehovah as great delight in burntofferings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of jehovah behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams. for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. because thou hast rejected the word of jehovah he hath also rejected thee from being king. and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of jehovah and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice. now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship jehovah.  and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of jehovah and jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over israel. and as samuel turned about to go away [saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his robe and it rent. and samuel said unto him jehovah hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou. and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent. then he said i have sinned yet honor me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship jehovah thy god. so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped jehovah. then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites. and agag came unto him cheerfully. and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past. and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women. and samuel hewed agag in pieces before jehovah in gilgal. then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul.  and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death for samuel mourned for saul and jehovah repented that he had made saul king over israel. and jehovah said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from being king over israel fill thy horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons. and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me. and jehovah said take a heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to jehovah. and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will show thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee. and samuel did that which jehovah spake and came to bethlehem. and the elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto jehovah sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice. and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely jehovahs anointed is before him.  but jehovah said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have rejected him for [jehovah seeth] not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but jehovah looketh on the heart. then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel. and he said neither hath jehovah chosen this. then jesse made shammah to pass by. and he said neither hath jehovah chosen this. and jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel. and samuel said unto jesse jehovah hath not chosen these. and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he is keeping the sheep. and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither. and he sent and brought him in. now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon. and jehovah said arise anoint him for this is he.  then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of jehovah came mightily upon david from that day forward. so samuel rose up and went to ramah. now the spirit of jehovah departed from saul and an evil spirit from jehovah troubled him. and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee. let our lord now command thy servants that are before thee to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well. and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me. then answered one of the young men and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the beth lehemite that is skilful in playing and a mighty man of valor and a man of war and prudent in speech and a comely person and jehovah is with him. wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son who is with the sheep.  and jesse took an ass [laden] with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul. and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armorbearer. and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favor in my sight. and it came to pass when the [evil] spirit from god was upon saul that david took the harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him. now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and they were gathered together at socoh which belongeth to judah and encamped between socoh and azekah in ephesdammim. and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and encamped in the vale of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines. and the philistines stood on the mountain on the one side and israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them. and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span.  and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was clad with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron and his shieldbearer went before him. and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me. if he be able to fight with me and kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us. and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together. and when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid.  now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehem judah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man was an old man in the days of saul stricken [in years] among men. and the three eldest sons of jesse had gone after saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah. and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul. now david went to and fro from saul to feed his fathers sheep at bethlehem. and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days. and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry [them] quickly to the camp to thy brethren and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge. now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the vale of elah fighting with the philistines.  and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the place of the wagons as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. and israel and the philistines put the battle in array army against army. and david left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army and came and saluted his brethren. and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the ranks of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them. and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid. and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in israel.  and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him. and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why art thou come down and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. and david said what have i now done is there not a cause and he turned away from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner. and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him. and david said to saul let no mans heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine.  and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth. and david said unto saul thy servant was keeping his fathers sheep and when there came a lion or a bear and took a lamb out of the flock i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him. thy servant smote both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god. and david said jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine. and saul said unto david go and jehovah shall be with thee. and saul clad david with his apparel and he put a helmet of brass upon his head and he clad him with a coat of mail. and david girded his sword upon his apparel and he assayed to go for he had not proved it. and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them. and david put them off him.  and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in the shepherds bag which he had even in his wallet and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine. and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him. and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and withal of a fair countenance. and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods. and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field. then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin but i come to thee in the name of jehovah of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied.  this day will jehovah deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from off thee and i will give the dead bodies of the host of the philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel and that all this assembly may know that jehovah saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is jehovahs and he will give you into our hand. and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine. and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth.  so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david. then david ran and stood over the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith. and when the philistines saw that their champion was dead they fled.  and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou comest to gai and to the gates of ekron. and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron. and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they plundered their camp. and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent. and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell. and the king said inquire thou whose son the stripling is. and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand.  and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the beth lehemite. and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul.  and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers house. then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul. and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his apparel even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. and david went out whithersoever saul sent him [and] behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and it was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of sauls servants. and it came to pass as they came when david returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with timbrels with joy and with instruments of music. and the women sang one to another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands.  and saul was very wroth and this saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom and saul eyed david from that day and forward.  and it came to pass on the morrow that an evil spirit from god came mightily upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as he did day by day. and saul had his spear in his hand and saul cast the spear for he said i will smite david even to the wall. and david avoided out of his presence twice. and saul was afraid of david because jehovah was with him and was departed from saul. therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people. and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and jehovah was with him. and when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he stood in awe of him. but all israel and judah loved david for he went out and came in before them. and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight jehovahs battles. for saul said let not my hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him.  and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life [or] my fathers family in israel that i should be sonin law to the king but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife. and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him. and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him. wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my soninlaw a second time. and saul commanded his servants [saying] commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the kings soninlaw. and sauls servants spake those words in the ears of david. and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be the kings sonin law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david.  and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but a hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies. now saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines. and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the kings sonin law. and the days were not expired and david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full number to the king that he might be the kings soninlaw. and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife. and saul saw and knew that jehovah was with david and michal sauls daughter loved him. and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul was davids enemy continually. then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass as often as they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by. and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should slay david. but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david.  and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to slay thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself in the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and if i see aught i will tell thee. and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very good for he put his life in his hand and smote the philistine and jehovah wrought a great victory for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as jehovah liveth he shall not be put to death. and jonathan called david and jonathan showed him all those things. and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as beforetime.  and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled before him. and an evil spirit from jehovah was upon saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand and david was playing with his hand. and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the spear but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the spear into the wall and david fled and escaped that night. and saul sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying if thou save not thy life tonight to morrow thou wilt be slain. so michal let david down through the window and he went and fled and escaped. and michal took the teraphim and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats [hair] at the head thereof and covered it with the clothes. and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick. and saul sent the messengers to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him.  and when the messengers came in behold the teraphim was in the bed with the pillow of goats [hair] at the head thereof. and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me thus and let mine enemy go so that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee now david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him. and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth. and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah. and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as head over them the spirit of god came upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied. and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they also prophesied. and saul sent messengers again the third time and they also prophesied. then went he also to ramah and came to the great well that is in secu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they are at naioth in ramah.  and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god came upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah. and he also stripped off his clothes and he also prophesied before samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life and he said unto him far from it thou shalt not die behold my father doeth nothing either great or small but that he discloseth it unto me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so. and david sware moreover and said thy father knoweth well that i have found favor in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death. then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee.  and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. if thy father miss me at all then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be wroth then know that evil is determined by him. therefore deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of jehovah with thee but if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee then said david to jonathan who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field. and they went out both of them into the field.  and jonathan said unto david jehovah the god of israel [be witness] when i have sounded my father about this time tomorrow [or] the third day behold if there be good toward david shall i not then send unto thee and disclose it unto thee jehovah do so to jonathan and more also should it please my father to do thee evil if i disclose it not unto thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and jehovah be with thee as he hath been with my father. and thou shalt not only while yet i live show me the lovingkindness of jehovah that i die not but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when jehovah hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth. so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david [saying] and jehovah will require it at the hand of davids enemies. and jonathan caused david to swear again for the love that he had to him for he loved him as he loved his own soul. then jonathan said unto him tomorrow is the new moon and thou wilt be missed because thy seat will be empty.  and when thou hast stayed three days thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel. and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark. and behold i will send the lad [saying] go find the arrows. if i say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them and come for there is peace to thee and no hurt as jehovah liveth. but if i say thus unto the boy behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for jehovah hath sent thee away. and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold jehovah is between thee and me for ever. so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat food. and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon the seat by the wall and jonathan stood up and abner sat by sauls side but davids place was empty. nevertheless saul spake not anything that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean.  and it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon [which was] the second [day] that davids place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to beth lehem and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me [to be there] and now if i have found favor in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren. therefore he is not come unto the kings table. then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of a perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own shame and unto the shame of thy mothers nakedness for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom. wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die. and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore should he be put to death what hath he done  and saul cast his spear at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put david to death. so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no food the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame. and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him. and he said unto his lad run find now the arrows which i shoot. and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him. and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not. and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master. but the lad knew not anything only jonathan and david knew the matter. and jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city.  and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of [a place] toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded. and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of jehovah saying jehovah shall be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever. and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city. then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech came to meet david trembling and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know anything of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed the young men to such and such a place. now therefore what is under thy hand give me five loaves of bread in my hand or whatsoever there is present.  and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is holy bread if only the young men have kept themselves from women. and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days when i came out the vessels of the young men were holy though it was but a common journey how much more then today shall their vessels be holy so the priest gave him holy [bread] for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before jehovah to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before jehovah and his name was doeg the edomite the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to saul. and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thy hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required haste.  and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the vale of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here. and david said there is none like that give it me. and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath. and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath. and he changed his behavior before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me do i lack madmen that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence shall this fellow come into my house  david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave of adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to him. and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men. and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth [and be] with you till i know what god will do for me. and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the stronghold. and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the stronghold depart and get thee into the land of judah. then david departed and came into the forest of hereth. and saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul was sitting in gibeah under the tamarisktree in ramah with his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him.  and saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day then answered doeg the edomite who stood by the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub. and he inquired of jehovah for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine. then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king. and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub. and he answered here i am my lord.  and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast inquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day then ahimelech answered the king and said and who among all thy servants is so faithful as david who is the kings soninlaw and is taken into thy council and is honorable in thy house  have i today begun to inquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute anything unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this less or more. and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy fathers house. and the king said unto the guard that stood about him turn and slay the priests of jehovah because their hand also is with david and because they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me. but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of jehovah.  and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests. and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword. and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david. and abiathar told david that saul had slain jehovahs priests. and david said unto abiathar i knew on that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned [the death] of all the persons of thy fathers house.  abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life for with me thou shalt be in safeguard. and they told david saying behold the philistines are fighting against keilah and are robbing the threshingfloors. therefore david inquired of jehovah saying shall i go and smite these philistines and jehovah said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah.  and davids men said unto him behold we are afraid here in judah how much more then if we go to keilah against the armies of the philistines then david inquired of jehovah yet again. and jehovah answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thy hand. and david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and slew them with a great slaughter. so david save the inhabitants of keilah. and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand.  and it was told saul that david was come to keilah. and saul said god hath delivered him into my hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. and saul summoned all the people to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men. and david knew that saul was devising mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod.  then said david o jehovah the god of israel thy servant hath surely heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake. will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o jehovah the god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant. and jehovah said he will come down. then said david will the men of keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of saul and jehovah said they will deliver thee up. then david and his men who were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go. and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth. and david abode in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hillcountry in the wilderness of ziph. and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand. and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in the wood. and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god.  and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth. and they two made a covenant before jehovah and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house. then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of the desert now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him up into the kings hand. and saul said blessed be ye of jehovah for ye have had compassion on me. go i pray you make yet more sure and know and see his place where his haunt is [and] who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly. see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurkingplaces where he hideth himself and come ye again to me of a certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out among all the thousands of judah.  and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the arabah on the south of the desert. and saul and his men went to seek him. and they told david wherefore he came down to the rock and abode in the wilderness of maon. and when saul heard [that] he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon. and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them. but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have made a raid upon the land. so saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place sela hammahlekoth. and david went up from thence and dwelt in the strongholds of engedi. and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of en gedi.  then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet. now david and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave. and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which jehovah said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thy hand and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily. and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt. and he said unto his men jehovah forbid that i should do this thing unto my lord jehovahs anointed to put forth my hand against him seeing he is jehovahs anointed. so david checked his men with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul. and saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way.  david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king. and when saul looked behind him david bowed with his face to the earth and did obeisance. and david said to saul wherefore hearkenest thou to mens words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt behold this day thine eyes have seen how that jehovah had delivered thee to day into my hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but [mine eye] spared thee and i said i will not put forth my hand against my lord for he is jehovahs anointed. moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand and i have not sinned against thee though thou huntest after my life to take it. jehovah judge between me and thee and jehovah avenge me of thee but my hand shall not be upon thee. as saith the proverb of the ancients out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness but my hand shall not be upon thee. after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea.  jehovah therefore be judge and give sentence between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thy hand. and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept. and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rendered unto me good whereas i have rendered unto thee evil. and thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand thou killedst me not. for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day. and now behold i know that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thy hand. swear now therefore unto me by jehovah that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house. and david sware unto saul. and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.  and samuel died and all israel gathered themselves together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah. and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran. and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel. now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and the woman was of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb. and david heard in the wilderness that nabal was shearing his sheep. and david sent ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name and thus shall ye say to him that liveth [in prosperity] peace be unto thee and peace be to thy house and peace be unto all that thou hast. and now i have heard that thou hast shearers thy shepherds have now been with us and we did them no hurt neither was there aught missing unto them all the while they were in carmel.  ask thy young men and they will tell thee wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thy hand unto thy servants and to thy son david. and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased. and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there are many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master. shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men of whom i know not whence they are so davids young men turned on their way and went back and came and told him according to all these words. and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword. and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the baggage.  but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed at them. but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we anything as long as we went with them when we were in the fields they were a wall unto us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his house for he is such a worthless fellow that one cannot speak to him. then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses. and she said unto her young men go on before me behold i come after you. but she told not her husband nabal. and it was so as she rode on her ass and came down by the covert of the mountain that behold david and his men came down toward her and she met them.  now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath returned me evil for good. god do so unto the enemies of david and more also if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one manchild. and when abigail saw david she hasted and alighted from her ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground. and she fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me be the iniquity and let thy handmaid i pray thee speak in thine ears and hear thou the words of thy handmaid. let not my lord i pray thee regard this worthless fellow even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send. now therefore my lord as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now therefore let thine enemies and them that seek evil to my lord be as nabal.  and now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord. forgive i pray thee the trespass of thy handmaid for jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of jehovah and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days. and though men be risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy soul yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with jehovah thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as from the hollow of a sling. and it shall come to pass when jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee prince over israel that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood without cause or that my lord hath avenged himself. and when jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thy handmaid. and david said to abigail blessed be jehovah the god of israel who sent thee this day to meet me  and blessed be thy discretion and blessed be thou that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness and from avenging myself with mine own hand. for in very deed as jehovah the god of israel liveth who hath withholden me from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light so much as one manchild. so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and he said unto her go up in peace to thy house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person. and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light. and it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal that his wife told him these things and his heart died within him and he became as a stone. and it came to pass about ten days after that jehovah smote nabal so that he died.  and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be jehovah that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept back his servant from evil and the evildoing of nabal hath jehovah returned upon his own head. and david sent and spake concerning abigail to take her to him to wife. and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david hath sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife. and she arose and bowed herself with her face to the earth and said behold thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that followed her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife. david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they became both of them his wives. now saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to palti the son of laish who was of gallim. and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before the desert  then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph. and saul encamped in the hill of hachilah which is before the desert by the way. but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness. david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come of a certainty. and david arose and came to the place where saul had encamped and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay within the place of the wagons and the people were encamped round about him. then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee. so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons with his spear stuck in the ground at his head and abner and the people lay round about him.  then said abishai to david god hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear to the earth at one stroke and i will not smite him the second time. and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can put forth his hand against jehovahs anointed and be guiltless and david said as jehovah liveth jehovah will smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall go down into battle and perish. jehovah forbid that i should put forth my hand against jehovahs anointed but now take i pray thee the spear that is at his head and the cruse of water and let us go. so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls head and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither did any awake for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from jehovah was fallen upon them. then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain afar off a great space being between them and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king  and david said to abner art not thou a [valiant] man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. this thing is not good that thou hast done. as jehovah liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept watch over your lord jehovahs anointed. and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his head. and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king. and he said wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in my hand now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. if it be jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if it be the children of men cursed be they before jehovah for they have driven me out this day that i should not cleave unto the inheritance of jehovah saying go serve other gods.  now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of jehovah for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my life was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly. and david answered and said behold the spear o king let then one of the young men come over and fetch it. and jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness forasmuch as jehovah delivered thee into my hand to day and i would not put forth my hand against jehovahs anointed. and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of jehovah and let him deliver me out of all tribulation. then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do mightily and shalt surely prevail. so david went his way and saul returned to his place.  and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should escape into the land of the philistines and saul will despair of me to seek me any more in all the borders of israel so shall i escape out of his hand. and david arose and passed over he and the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath. and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife. and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him. and david said unto achish if now i have found favor in thine eyes let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day. and the number of the days that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months.  and david and his men went up and made a raid upon the geshurites and the girzites and the amalekites for those [nations] were the inhabitants of the land who were of old as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt.  and david smote the land and saved neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and he returned and came to achish. and achish said against whom have ye made a raid today and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites. and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring them to gath saying lest they should tell of us saying so did david and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the philistines. and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever.  and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare to fight with israel. and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me in the host thou and thy men. and david said to achish therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of my head for ever.  now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city. and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land. and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and encamped in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they encamped in gilboa. and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. and when saul inquired of jehovah jehovah answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets.  then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and inquire of her. and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor. and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and went he and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said divine unto me i pray thee by the familiar spirit and bring me up whomsoever i shall name unto thee. and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die and saul sware to her by jehovah saying as jehovah liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel. and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul.  and the king said unto her be not afraid for what seest thou and the woman said unto saul i see a god coming up out of the earth. and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a robe. and saul perceived that it was samuel and he bowed with his face to the ground and did obeisance. and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do. and samuel said wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing jehovah is departed from thee and is become thine adversary and jehovah hath done unto thee as he spake by me and jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand and given it to thy neighbor even to david. because thou obeyedst not the voice of jehovah and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.  moreover jehovah will deliver israel also with thee into the hand of the philistines and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me jehovah will deliver the host of israel also into the hand of the philistines. then saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night. and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way. but he refused and said i will not eat. but his servants together with the woman constrained him and he hearkened unto their voice. so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed.  and the woman had a fatted calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and she took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat. then they rose up and went away that night. now the philistines gathered together all their hosts to aphek and the israelites encamped by the fountain which is in jezreel. and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands and david and his men passed on in the rearward with achish. then said the princes of the philistines what [do] these hebrews [here] and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel who hath been with me these days or [rather] these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell away [unto me] unto this day  but he princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make the man return that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he become an adversary to us for wherewith should this [fellow] reconcile himself unto his lord should it not be with the heads of these men is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands then achish called david and said unto him as jehovah liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favor thee not. wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines. and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been before thee unto this day that i may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king  and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle. wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee and as soon as ye are up early in the morning and have light depart. so david rose up early he and his men to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines. and the philistines went up to jezreel. and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had made a raid upon the south and upon ziklag and had smitten ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken captive the women [and all] that were therein both small and great they slew not any but carried them off and went their way. and when david and his men came to the city behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive. then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.  and davids two wives were taken captive ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite. and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david strengthened himself in jehovah his god. and david said to abiathar the priest the son of ahimelech i pray thee bring me hither the ephod. and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david. and david inquired of jehovah saying if i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake [them] and shalt without fail recover [all]. so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed. but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred stayed behind who were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor. and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they gave him water to drink.  and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights. and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days ago i fell sick. we made a raid upon the south of the cherethites and upon that which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire. and david said to him wilt thou bring me down to this troop and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me up into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this troop. and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad over all the ground eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah. and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled.  and david recovered all that the amalekites had taken and david rescued his two wives. and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them david brought back all. and david took all the flocks and the herds [which] they drove before those [other] cattle and said this is davids spoil. and david came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow david whom also they had made to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them. then answered all the wicked men and base fellows of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that he may lead them away and depart. then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which jehovah hath given unto us who hath preserved us and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.  and who will hearken unto you in this matter for as his share is that goeth down to the battle so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage they shall share alike. and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day. and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of jehovah to them that were in bethel and to them that were in ramoth of the south and to them that were in jattir and to them that were in aroer and to them that were in siphmoth and to them that were in eshtemoa and to them that were in racal and to them that were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them that were in the cities of the kenites and to them that were in hormah and to them that were in bor ashan and to them that were in athach and to them that were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt. now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa.  and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul. and the battle went sore against saul and the archers overtook him and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers. then said saul to his armorbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. but his armorbearer would not for he was sore afraid. therefore saul took his sword and fell upon it. and when his armorbearer saw that saul was dead he likewise fell upon his sword and died with him. so saul died and his three sons and his armorbearer and all his men that same day together. and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were beyond the jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them. and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa.  and they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols and to the people. and they put his armor in the house of the ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan. and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard concerning him that which the philistines had done to saul all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of beth shan and they came to jabesh and burnt them there. and they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisktree in jabesh and fasted seven days. and it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag it came to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance. and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped.  and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me. and he answered the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also. and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son are dead and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul was leaning upon his spear and lo the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me. and i answered here am i. and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite. and he said unto me stand i pray thee beside me and slay me for anguish hath taken hold of me because my life is yet whole in me. so i stood beside him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord. then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him  and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of jehovah and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword. and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a sojourner an amalekite. and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy jehovahs anointed and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him. and he smote him so that he died. and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain jehovahs anointed. and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son and he bade them teach the children of judah [the song of] the bow behold it is written in the book of jashar thy glory o israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of ashkelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew nor rain upon you neither fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away the shield of saul not anointed with oil. from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty. saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions. ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet delicately who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle jonathan is slain upon thy high places. i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women. how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished and it came to pass after this that david inquired of jehovah saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and jehovah said unto him go up. and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron.  so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite. and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron. and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah. and they told david saying the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul. and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of jehovah that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him. and now jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing. now therefore let your hands be strong and be ye valiant for saul your lord is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them. now abner the son of ner captain of sauls host had taken ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim and he made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel.  ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and he reigned two years. but the house of judah followed david. and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months. and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon. and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met them by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.  and abner said to joab let the young men i pray thee arise and play before us. and joab said let them arise. then they arose and went over by number twelve for benjamin and for ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david. and they caught every one his fellow by the head and [thrust] his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkath hazzurim which is in gibeon. and the battle was very sore that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david.  and the three sons of zeruiah were there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner. then abner looked behind him and said is it thou asahel and he answered it is i. and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armor. but asahel would not turn aside from following him.  and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body so that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still. but joab and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon.  and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one band and stood on the top of a hill. then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren and joab said as god liveth if thou hadst not spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone away nor followed every one his brother.  so joab blew the trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more. and abner and his men went all that night through the arabah and they passed over the jordan and went through all bithron and came to mahanaim. and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen men and asahel. but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abners men [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.  and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem. and joab and his men went all night and the day brake upon them at hebron. now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david and david waxed stronger and stronger but the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker. and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital and the sixth ithream of eglah davids wife. these were born to david in hebron. and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong in the house of saul. now saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and [ishbosheth] said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine  then was abner very wroth for the words of ish bosheth and said am i a dogs head that belongeth to judah this day do i show kindness unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. god do so to abner and more also if as jehovah hath sworn to david i do not even so to him to transfer the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba. and he could not answer abner another word because he feared him. and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land saying [also] make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee. and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face.  and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying deliver me my wife michal whom i betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the philistines. and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from paltiel the son of laish. and her husband went with her weeping as he went and followed her to bahurim. then said abner unto him go return and he returned. and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying in times past ye sought for david to be king over you now then do it for jehovah hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies. and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and to the whole house of benjamin. so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him. and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast.  and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. and david sent abner away and he went in peace. and behold the servants of david and joab came from a foray and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace. when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace. then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest. and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner and they brought him back from the well of sirah but david knew it not.  and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there in the body so that he died for the blood of asahel his brother. and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before jehovah for ever of the blood of abner the son of ner let it fall upon the head of joab and upon all his fathers house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth by the sword or that lacketh bread. so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had killed their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle. and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner. and king david followed the bier. and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept. and the king lamented for abner and said should abner die as a fool dieth  thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before the children of iniquity so didst thou fall. and all the people wept again over him. and all the people came to cause david to eat bread while it was yet day but david sware saying god do so to me and more also if i taste bread or aught else till the sun be down. and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. so all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner. and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah are too hard for me jehovah reward the evildoer according to his wickedness. and when [ish bosheth] sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands became feeble and all the israelites were troubled.  and [ish bosheth] sauls son [had] two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon the beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also is reckoned to benjamin and the beerothites fled to gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day. now jonathan sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet. he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame. and his name was mephibosheth. and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth as he took his rest at noon. and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him in the body and rechab and baanah his brother escaped. now when they came into the house as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and went by the way of the arabah all night.  and they brought the head of ish bosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ish bosheth the son of saul thine enemy who sought thy life and jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed. and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as jehovah liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag which was the reward i gave him for his tidings. how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up beside the pool in hebron. but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of abner in hebron. then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.  in times past when saul was king over us it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in israel and jehovah said to thee thou shalt be shepherd of my people israel and thou shalt be prince over israel. so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a covenant with them in hebron before jehovah and they anointed david king over israel. david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years. in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah. and the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the inhabitants of the land who spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither. nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david.  and david said on that day whosoever smiteth the jebusites let him get up to the watercourse and [smite] the lame and the blind that are hated of davids soul. wherefore they say there are the blind and the lame he cannot come into the house. and david dwelt in the stronghold and called it the city of david. and david built round about from millo and inward. and david waxed greater and greater for jehovah the god of hosts was with him. and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david a house. and david perceived that jehovah had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels sake. and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david. and these are the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammua and shobab and nathan and solomon and ibhar and elishua and nepheg and japhia and elishama and eliada and eliphelet.  and when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the stronghold. now the philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim. and david inquired of jehovah saying shall i go up against the philistines wilt thou deliver them into my hand and jehovah said unto david go up for i will certainly deliver the philistines into thy hand. and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and he said jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me like the breach of waters. therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim. and they left their images there and david and his men took them away. and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim. and when david inquired of jehovah he said thou shalt not go up make a circuit behind them and come upon them over against the mulberrytrees.  and it shall be when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberrytrees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then is jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the philistines. and david did so as jehovah commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gezer. and david again gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand. and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baalejudah to bring up from thence the ark of god which is called by the name even the name of jehovah of hosts that sitteth [above] the cherubim. and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in the hill and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drove the new cart. and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was in the hill with the ark of god and ahio went before the ark. and david and all the house of israel played before jehovah with all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with castanets and with cymbals.  and when they came to the threshingfloor of nacon uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen stumbled. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god. and david was displeased because jehovah had broken forth upon uzzah and he called that place perez uzzah unto this day. and david was afraid of jehovah that day and he said how shall the ark of jehovah come unto me so david would not remove the ark of jehovah unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obed edom the gittite. and the ark of jehovah remained in the house of obed edom the gittite three months and jehovah blessed obed edom and all his house. and it was told king david saying jehovah hath blessed the house of obed edom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god. and david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with joy. and it was so that when they that bare the ark of jehovah had gone six paces he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.  and david danced before jehovah with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod. so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet. and it was so as the ark of jehovah came into the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david leaping and dancing before jehovah and she despised him in her heart. and they brought in the ark of jehovah and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and david offered burntofferings and peace offerings before jehovah. and when david had made an end of offering the burntoffering and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of jehovah of hosts. and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel both to men and women to every one a cake of bread and a portion [of flesh] and a cake of raisins. so all the people departed every one to his house.  then david returned to bless his household. and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself and david said unto michal [it was] before jehovah who chose me above thy father and above all his house to appoint me prince over the people of jehovah over israel therefore will i play before jehovah. and i will be yet more vile than this and will be base in mine own sight but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken of them shall i be had in honor. and michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death. and it came to pass when the king dwelt in his house and jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains. and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thy heart for jehovah is with thee.  and it came to pass the same night that the word of jehovah came unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david thus saith jehovah shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. in all places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to be shepherd of my people israel saying why have ye not built me a house of cedar now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith jehovah of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep that thou shouldest be prince over my people over israel and i have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and i will make thee a great name like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.  and i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as at the first and [as] from the day that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and i will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. moreover jehovah telleth thee that jehovah will make thee a house. when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee that shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom. he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee. and thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever. according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david.  then david the king went in and sat before jehovah and he said who am i o lord jehovah and what is my house that thou hast brought me thus far and this was yet a small thing in thine eyes o lord jehovah but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come and this [too] after the manner of men o lord jehovah  and what can david say more unto thee for thou knowest thy servant o lord jehovah. for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou wrought all this greatness to make thy servant know it. wherefore thou art great o jehovah god for there is none like thee neither is there any god besides thee according to all that we have heard with our ears. and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem unto himself for a people and to make him a name and to do great things for you and terrible things for thy land before thy people whom thou redeemest to thee out of egypt [from] the nations and their gods and thou didst establish to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou jehovah becamest their god.  and now o jehovah god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house confirm thou it for ever and do as thou hast spoken. and let thy name be magnified for ever saying jehovah of hosts is god over israel and the house of thy servant david shall be established before thee.  for thou o jehovah of hosts the god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee a house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. and now o lord jehovah thou art god and thy words are truth and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord jehovah hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the philistines.  and he smote moab and measured them with the line making them to lie down on the ground and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. and the moabites became servants to david and brought tribute. david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his dominion at the river. and david took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david hocked all the chariot horses but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.  and when the syrians of damascus came to succor hadadezer king of zobah david smote of the syrians two and twenty thousand men. then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought tribute. and jehovah gave victory to david whithersoever he went. and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem. and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass.  and when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi. and [joram] brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass these also did king david dedicate unto jehovah with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah. and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting the syrians in the valley of salt even eighteen thousand men. and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all the edomites became servants to david. and jehovah gave victory to david whithersoever he went. and david reigned over all israel and david executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder  and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were priests and seraiah was scribe and benaiah the son of jehoiada [was over] the cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief ministers. and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may show him kindness for jonathans sake and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and they called him unto david and the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he. and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may show the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son who is lame of his feet. and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lo debar. then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lo debar. and mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul came unto david and fell on his face and did obeisance. and david said mephibosheth. and he answered behold thy servant  and david said unto him fear not for i will surely show thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. and he did obeisance and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him all that pertained to saul and to all his house have i given unto thy masters son. and thou shalt till the land for him thou and thy sons and thy servants and thou shalt bring in [the fruits] that thy masters son may have bread to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table. now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant so shall thy servant do. as for mephibosheth [said the king] he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sons. and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was mica. and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth.  so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table. and he was lame in both his feet. and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead. and david said i will show kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father showed kindness unto me. so david sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon. but the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honor thy father in that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it so hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away. when they told it unto david he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed. and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return.  and when the children of ammon saw that they were become odious to david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zobah twenty thousand footmen and the king of maacah with a thousand men and the men of tob twelve thousand men. and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men. and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate and the syrians of zobah and of rehob and the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the field. now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and he put them in array against the children of ammon. and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee.  be of good courage and let us play the man for our people and for the cities of our god and jehovah do that which seemeth him good. so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him. and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai and entered into the city. then joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem. and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they gathered themselves together. and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam with shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer at their head. and it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came to helam. and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him. and the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians [the men of] seven hundred chariots and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host so that he died there.  and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with israel and served them. so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more. and it came to pass at the return of the year at the time when kings go out [to battle] that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah. but david tarried at jerusalem. and it came to pass at eventide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. and david send and inquired after the woman. and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house. and the woman conceived and she sent and told david and said i am with child. and david sent to joab [saying] send me uriah the hittite. and joab sent uriah to david.  and when uriah was come unto him david asked of him how joab did and how the people fared and how the war prospered. and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet. and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess [of food] from the king. but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house. and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah art thou not come from a journey wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in booths and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field shall i then go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing. and david said to uriah tarry here today also and tomorrow i will let thee depart. so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow. and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house.  and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah. and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die. and it came to pass when joab kept watch upon the city that he assigned uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people even of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also. then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war and he charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king it shall be that if the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died at thebez why went ye so nigh the wall then shalt thou say thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also.  so the messenger went and came and showed david all that joab had sent him for. and the messenger said unto david the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate. and the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall and some of the kings servants are dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also. then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him. and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she made lamentation for her husband. and when the mourning was past david sent and took her home to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son. but the thing that david had done displeased jehovah. and jehovah sent nathan unto david. and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor. the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own morsel and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter. and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him. and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as jehovah liveth the man that hath done this is worthy to die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity. and nathan said to david thou art the man. thus saith jehovah the god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would have added unto thee such and such things.  wherefore hast thou despised the word of jehovah to do that which is evil in his sight thou hast smitten uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon. now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife. thus saith jehovah behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun. and david said unto nathan i have sinned against jehovah. and nathan said unto david jehovah also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die. howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of jehovah to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. and nathan departed unto his house. and jehovah struck the child that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick.  david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth. and the elders of his house arose [and stood] beside him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them. and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died. and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he hearkened not unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that his servants were whispering together david perceived that the child was dead and david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead. then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and he came into the house of jehovah and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat. then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread.  and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who knoweth whether jehovah will not be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he will not return to me. and david comforted bath sheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon. and jehovah loved him and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah for jehovahs sake. now joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city. and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah yea i have taken the city of waters. now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name. and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it.  and he took the crown of their king from off his head and the weight thereof was a talent of gold and [in it were] precious stones and it was set on davids head. and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much. and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon. and david and all the people returned unto jerusalem. and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her. and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed hard to amnon to do anything unto her. but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtle man. and he said unto him why o son of the king art thou thus lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absaloms sister.  and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him let my sister tamar come i pray thee and give me bread to eat and dress the food in my sight that i may see it and eat it from her hand. so amnon lay down and feigned himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king let her sister tamar come i pray thee and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat from her hand. then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnons house and dress him food. so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid down. and she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes. and she took the pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat. and amnon said have out all men from me. and they went out every man from him. and amnon said unto tamar bring the food into the chamber that i may eat from thy hand. and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother.  and when she had brought them near unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister. and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly. and i whither shall i carry my shame and as for thee thou wilt be as one of the fools in israel. now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee. howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she he forced her and lay with her.  then amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. and amnon said unto her arise be gone. and she said unto him not so because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that thou didst unto me. but he would not hearken unto her. then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her.  and she had a garment of divers colors upon her for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled. then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her. and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her and she laid her hand on her head and went her way crying aloud as she went. and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but now hold thy peace my sister he is thy brother take not this thing to heart. so tamar remained desolate in her brother absaloms house. but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth. and absalom spake unto amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar.  and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons. and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheep shearers let the king i pray thee and his servants go with thy servant.  and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all go lest we be burdensome unto thee. and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him. then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us. and the king said unto him why should he go with thee but absalom pressed him and he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him. and absalom commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant. and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded. then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled. and it came to pass while they were in the way that the tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them left.  then the king arose and rent his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.  and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar. now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is dead. but absalom fled. and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him. and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons are come as thy servant said so it is. and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihur king of geshur. and [david] mourned for his son every day.  so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years. and [the soul of] king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead.  now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward absalom. and joab sent to tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel i pray thee and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead and go in to the king and speak on this manner unto him. so joab put the words in her mouth. and when the woman of tekoa spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king. and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered of a truth i am a widow and my husband is dead. and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and killed him. and behold the whole family is risen against thy handmaid and they say deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and so destroy the heir also. thus will they quench my coal which is left and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.  and the king said unto the woman go to thy house and i will give charge concerning thee. and the woman of tekoa said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltless. and the king said whosoever saith aught unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more. then said she i pray thee let the king remember jehovah thy god that the avenger of blood destroy not any more lest they destroy my son. and he said as jehovah liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. then the woman said let thy handmaid i pray thee speak a word unto my lord the king. and he said say on. and the woman said wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of god for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. for we must needs die and are as water split on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god take away life but deviseth means that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.  now therefore seeing that i am come to speak this word unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. for the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god. then thy handmaid said let i pray thee the word of my lord the king be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad and jehovah thy god be with thee. then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee aught that i shall ask thee. and the woman said let my lord the king now speak. and the king said is the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid  to change the face of the matter hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth. and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom back. and joab fell to the ground on his face and did obeisance and blessed the king and joab said today thy servant knoweth that i have found favor in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath performed the request of his servant. so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem. and the king said let him turn to his own house but let him not see my face. so absalom turned to his own house and saw not the kings face. now in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. and when he cut the hair of his head now it was at every years end that he cut it because it was heavy on him therefore he cut it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight.  and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance. and absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and he saw not the kings face. then absalom sent for joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come. therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire. and absaloms servants set the field on fire. then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it were better for me to be there still. now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be iniquity in me let him kill me. so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom.  and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him a chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him. and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel. and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice and it was so that when any man came nigh to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took hold of him and kissed him. and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel. and it came to pass at the end of forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto jehovah in hebron.  for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if jehovah shall indeed bring me again to jerusalem then i will serve jehovah. and the king said unto him go in peace. so he arose and went to hebron. but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom is king in hebron. and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were invited and went in their simplicity and they knew not anything. and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counsellor from his city even from giloh while he was offering the sacrifices. and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom. and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom. and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for else none of us shall escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us quickly and bring down evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword.  and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose. and the king went forth and all his household after him. and the king left ten women that were concubines to keep the house. and the king went forth and all the people after him and they tarried in beth merhak. and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men that came after him from gath passed on before the king. then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return and abide with the king for thou art a foreigner and also an exile [return] to thine own place. whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee. and ittai answered the king and said as jehovah liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether for death or for life even there also will thy servant be.  and david said to ittai go and pass over. and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him. and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness. and lo zadok also [came] and all the levites with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city. and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favor in the eyes of jehovah he will bring me again and show me both it and his habitation but if he say thus i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. the king said also unto zadok the priest art thou [not] a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar. see i will tarry at the fords of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me. zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they abode there.  and david went up by the ascent of the [mount of] olives and wept as he went up and he had his head covered and went barefoot and all the people that were with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up. and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom. and david said o jehovah i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness. and it came to pass that when david was come to the top [of the ascent] where god was worshipped behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head. and david said unto him if thou passest on with me then thou wilt be a burden unto me but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant in time past so will i now be thy servant then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of ahithophel. and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests.  behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear. so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem. and when david was a little past the top [of the ascent] behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred clusters of raisins and a hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine. and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses are for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said today will the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father. then said the king to ziba behold thine is all that pertaineth unto mephibosheth. and ziba said i do obeisance let me find favor in thy sight my lord o king.  and when king david came to bahurim behold there came out thence a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came out and cursed still as he came. and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. and thus said shimei when he cursed begone begone thou man of blood and base fellow jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art [taken] in thine own mischief because thou art a man of blood. then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head. and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah because he curseth and because jehovah hath said unto him curse david who then shall say wherefore hast thou done so  and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son who came forth from my bowels seeketh my life how much more [may] this benjamite now [do it] let him alone and let him curse for jehovah hath bidden him. it may be that jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me and that jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day. so david and his men went by the way and shimei went along on the hillside over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust. and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and he refreshed himself there. and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him. and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom [long] live the king [long] live the king. and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom jehovah and this people and all the men of israel have chosen his will i be and with him will i abide.  and again whom should i serve [should i] not [serve] in the presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so will i be in thy presence. then said absalom to ahithophel give your counsel what we shall do. and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers concubines that he hath left to keep the house and all israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong. so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel. and the counsel of ahithophel which he gave in those days was as if a man inquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom. moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night and i will come upon him while he is weary and weakhanded and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only  and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned [so] all the people shall be in peace. and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel. then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith. and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do [after] his saying if not speak thou. and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given this time is not good. hushai said moreover thou knowest thy father and his men that they are mighty men and they are chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people. behold he is hid now in some pit or in some [other] place and it will come to pass when some of them are fallen at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom. and even he that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion will utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they that are with him are valiant men.  but i counsel that all israel be gathered together unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person. so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one. moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there. and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel. for jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that jehovah might bring evil upon absalom. then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled.  now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness but by all means pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him.  now jonathan and ahimaaz were staying by enrogel and a maidservant used to go and tell them and they went and told king david for they might not be seen to come into the city. but a lad saw them and told absalom and they went both of them away quickly and came to the house of a man in bahurim who had a well in his court and they went down thither. and the woman took and spread the covering over the wells mouth and strewed bruised grain thereon and nothing was known. and absaloms servants came to the woman to the house and they said where are ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they are gone over the brook of water. and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem. and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and they said unto david arise ye and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you.  then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over the jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the jordan.  and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home unto his city and set his house in order and hanged himself and he died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. then david came to mahanaim. and absalom passed over the jordan he and all the men of israel with him. and absalom set amasa over the host instead of joab. now amasa was the son of a man whose name was ithra the israelite that went in to abigal the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs mother. and israel and absalom encamped in the land of gilead. and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim brought beds and basins and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and meal and parched [grain] and beans and lentils and parched [pulse]  and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of the herd for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness. and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. and david sent forth the people a third part under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite. and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also. but the people said thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city. and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do. and the king stood by the gateside and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom. and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom. so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the forest of ephraim. and the people of israel were smitten there before the servants of david and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. for the battle was there spread over the face of all the country and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. and absalom chanced to meet the servants of david. and absalom was riding upon his mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between heaven and earth and the mule that was under him went on. and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanging in an oak.  and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest it and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten [pieces of] silver and a girdle. and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand yet would i not put forth my hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom. otherwise if i had dealt falsely against his life and there is no matter hid from the king then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me]. then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee. and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. and ten young men that bare joabs armor compassed about and smote absalom and slew him. and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people. and they took absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones and all israel fled every one to his tent.  now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called absaloms monument unto this day. then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies. and joab said unto him thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the kings son is dead. then said joab to the cushite go tell the king what thou hast seen. and the cushite bowed himself unto joab and ran. then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but come what may let me i pray thee also run after the cushite. and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings but come what may [said he] i will run. and he said unto him run. then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran the cushite.  now david was sitting between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone. and the watchman cried and told the king. and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth. and he came apace and drew near. and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold [another] man running alone. and the king said he also bringeth tidings. and the watchman said i think the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok. and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings. and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well. and he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth and said blessed be jehovah thy god who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. and the king said is it well with the young man absalom and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the kings servant even me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was.  and the king said turn aside and stand here. and he turned aside and stood still. and behold the cushite came and the cushite said tidings for my lord the king for jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. and the king said unto the cushite is it well with the young man absalom and the cushite answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is. and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would i had died for thee o absalom my son my son and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom. and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day the king grieveth for his son. and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. and the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son  and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants who this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines in that thou lovest them that hate thee and hatest them that love thee. for thou hast declared this day that princes and servants are nought unto thee for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well. now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by jehovah if thou go not forth there will not tarry a man with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now. then the king arose and sat in the gate. and they told unto all the people saying behold the king is sitting in the gate and all the people came before the king. now israel had fled every man to his tent.  and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies and he saved us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land from absalom. and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle. now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king [to bring him] to his house. ye are my brethren ye are my bone and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king and say ye to amasa art thou not my bone and my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab. and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as [the heart of] one man so that they sent unto the king [saying] return thou and all thy servants. so the king returned and came to the jordan. and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to bring the king over the jordan.  and shimei the son of gera the benjamite who was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david. and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went through the jordan in the presence of the king. and there went over a ferryboat to bring over the kings household and to do what he thought good. and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king when he was come over the jordan. and he said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart. for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come this day the first of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed jehovahs anointed  and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel and the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die. and the king sware unto him. and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and he had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go with the king because thy servant is lame. and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes.  for all my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. what right therefore have i yet that i should cry any more unto the king and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i say thou and ziba divide the land. and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house. and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and he went over the jordan with the king to conduct him over the jordan. now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man. and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will sustain thee with me in jerusalem. and barzillai said unto the king how many are the days of the years of my life that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem  i am this day fourscore years old can i discern between good and bad can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king thy servant would but just go over the jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city by the grave of my father and my mother. but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee. and all the people went over the jordan and the king went over and the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place. so the king went over to gilgal and chimham went over with him and all the people of judah brought the king over and also half the people of israel.  and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and brought the king and his household over the jordan and all davids men with him and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then are ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all at the kings cost or hath he given us any gift and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more [right] in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel. and there happened to be there a base fellow whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew the trumpet and said we have no portion in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel. so all the men of israel went up from following david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from the jordan even to jerusalem.  and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and provided them with sustenance but went not in unto them. so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood. then said the king to amasa call me the men of judah together within three days and be thou here present. so amasa went to call [the men of] judah together but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. and david said to abishai now will sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fortified cities and escape out of our sight. and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri. when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa came to meet them. and joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out.  and joab said to amasa is it well with thee my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the body and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died. and joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri. and there stood by him one of joabs young men and said he that favoreth joab and he that is for david let him follow joab. and amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. and when the man saw that all the people stood still he carried amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a garment over him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri. and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaacah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him.  and they came and besieged him in abel of beth maacah and they cast up a mound against the city and it stood against the rampart and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down. then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee. and he came near unto her and the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am. then she said unto him hear the words of thy handmaid. and he answered i do hear. then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask [counsel] at abel and so they ended [the matter]. i am of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of jehovah and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy.  the matter is not so but a man of the hillcountry of ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city. and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and threw it out to joab. and he blew the trumpet and they were dispersed from the city every man to his tent. and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king. now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites and adoram was over the men subject to taskwork and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were priests and also ira the jairite was chief minister unto david. and there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david sought the face of jehovah. and jehovah said it is for saul and for his bloody house because he put to death the gibeonites.  and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of israel and judah and david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of jehovah and the gibeonites said unto him it is no matter of silver or gold between us and saul or his house neither is it for us to put any man to death in israel. and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you. and they said unto the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us [that] we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of israel  let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto jehovah in gibeah of saul the chosen of jehovah. and the king said i will give them. but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of jehovahs oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul.  but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she bare to adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the mountain before jehovah and they fell [all] seven together. and they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days at the beginning of barley harvest. and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night. and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done.  and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead who had stolen them from the street of beth shan where the philistines had hanged them in the day that the philistines slew saul in gilboa  and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. and they buried the bones of saul and jonathan his son in the country of benjamin in zela in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded. and after that god was entreated for the land. and the philistines had war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines. and david waxed faint and ishbibenob who was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight he being girded with a new [sword] thought to have slain david. but abishai the son of zeruiah succored him and smote the philistine and killed him. then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the lamp of israel.  and it came to pass after this that there was again war with the philistines at gob then sibbecai the hushathite slew saph who was of the sons of the giant.  and there was again war with the philistines at gob and elhanan the son of jaareoregim the bethlehemite slew goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam. and there was again war at gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant. and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimei davids brother slew him. these four were born to the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants. and david spake unto jehovah the words of this song in the day that jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul and he said jehovah is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer even mine god my rock in him will i take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence. i will call upon jehovah who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies. for the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodliness made me afraid  the cords of sheol were round about me the snares of death came upon me. in my distress i called upon jehovah yea i called unto my god and he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry [came] into his ears. then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken because he was wroth. there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it. he bowed the heavens also and came down and thick darkness was under his feet. and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he was seen upon the wings of the wind. and he made darkness pavilions round about him gathering of waters thick clouds of the skies. at the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled. jehovah thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice. and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them. then the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of jehovah at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  he sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy from them that hated me for they were too mighty for me. they came upon me in the day of my calamity but jehovah was my stay. he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me. jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. for i have kept the ways of jehovah and have not wickedly departed from my god. for all his ordinances were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them. i was also perfect toward him and i kept myself from mine iniquity. therefore hath jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eyesight. with the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful with the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward. and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down.  for thou art my lamp o jehovah and jehovah will lighten my darkness. for by thee i run upon a troop by my god do i leap over a wall. as for god his way is perfect the word of jehovah is tried he is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. for who is god save jehovah and who is a rock save our god god is my strong fortress and he guideth the perfect in his way. he maketh his feet like hinds [feet] and setteth me upon my high places. he teacheth my hands to war so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great. thou hast enlarged my steps under me and my feet have not slipped. i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them neither did i turn again till they were consumed. and i have consumed them and smitten them through so that they cannot arise yea they are fallen under my feet. for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me that i might cut off them that hate me. they looked but there was none to save even unto jehovah but he answered them not. then did i beat them small as the dust of the earth i did crush them as the mire of the streets and did spread them abroad. thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations a people whom i have not known shall serve me. the foreigners shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. the foreigners shall fade away and shall come trembling out of their close places. jehovah liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be god the rock of my salvation even the god that executeth vengeance for me and that bringeth down peoples under me and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me thou deliverest me from the violent man. therefore i will give thanks unto thee o jehovah among the nations and will sing praises unto thy name.  great deliverance giveth he to his king and showeth lovingkindness to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore. now these are the last words of david. david the son of jesse saith and the man who was raised on high saith the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel the spirit of jehovah spake by me and his word was upon my tongue. the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me one that ruleth over men righteously that ruleth in the fear of god [he shall be] as the light of the morning when the sun riseth a morning without clouds [when] the tender grass [springeth] out of the earth through clear shining after rain. verily my house is not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for it is all my salvation and all [my] desire although he maketh it not to grow. but the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away because they cannot be taken with the hand but the man that toucheth them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place  these are the names of the mighty men whom david had josheb basshebeth a tahchemonite chief of the captains the same was adino the eznite against eight hundred slain at one time. and after him was eleazar the son of dodai the son of an ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away. he arose and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and jehovah wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to take spoil. and after him was shammah the son of agee a hararite. and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a plot of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the philistines. but he stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and slew the philistines and jehovah wrought a great victory. and three of the thirty chief men went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines was encamped in the valley of rephaim.  and david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in beth lehem. and david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of beth lehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of beth lehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto jehovah. and he said be it far from me o jehovah that i should do this [shall i drink] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it. these things did the three mighty men. and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the three. and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had a name among the three. was he not most honorable of the three therefore he was made their captain howbeit he attained not unto the [first] three. and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he slew the two [sons of] ariel of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.  and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear. these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had a name among the three mighty men. he was more honorable than the thirty but he attained not to the [first] three. and david set him over his guard. asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem shammah the harodite elika the harodite helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anathothite mebunnai the hushathite zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite heleb the son of baanah the netophathite ittai the son of ribai of gibeah of the children of benjamin benaiah a pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash. abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite eliahba the shaalbonite the sons of jashen jonathan shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the ararite eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maacathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite  hezro the carmelite paarai the arbite igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite zelek the ammonite naharai the beerothite armorbearers to joab the son of zeruiah ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all. and again the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he moved david against them saying go number israel and judah. and the king said to joab the captain of the host who was with him go now to and fro through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beer sheba and number ye the people that i may know the sum of the people. and joab said unto the king now jehovah thy god add unto the people how many soever they may be a hundredfold and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing notwithstanding the kings word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host. and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel.  and they passed over the jordan and encamped in aroer on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of gad and unto jazer then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and round about to sidon and came to the stronghold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah at beer sheba. so when they had gone to and from through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. and joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men. and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. and david said unto jehovah i have sinned greatly in that which i have done but now o jehovah put away i beseech thee the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly. and when david rose up in the morning the word of jehovah came unto the prophet gad davids seer saying  go and speak unto david thus saith jehovah i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee. so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee or shall there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise thee and consider what answer i shall return to him that sent me. and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of jehovah for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man. so jehovah sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beer sheba seventy thousand men. and when the angel stretched out his hand toward jerusalem to destroy it jehovah repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough now stay thy hand. and the angel of jehovah was by the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite.  and david spake unto jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done perversely but these sheep what have they done let thy hand i pray thee be against me and against my fathers house. and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto jehovah in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite. and david went up according to the saying of gad as jehovah commanded. and araunah looked forth and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto jehovah that the plague may be stayed from the people. and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold the oxen for the burntoffering and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood all this o king doth araunah give unto the king. and araunah said unto the king jehovah thy god accept thee.  and the king said unto araunah nay but i will verily buy it of thee at a price. neither will i offer burntofferings unto jehovah my god which cost me nothing. so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. and david built there an altar unto jehovah and offered burntofferings and peace offerings. so jehovah was entreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel. now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat. wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat. so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of israel and found abishag the shunammite and brought her to the king. and the damsel was very fair and she cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not. then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him.  and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he was also a very goodly man and he was born after absalom. and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him. but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men that belonged to david were not with adonijah. and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of zoheleth which is beside en rogel and he called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not. then nathan spake unto bath sheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon.  go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thy handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words. and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite was ministering unto the king. and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king. and the king said what wouldest thou and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by jehovah thy god unto thy handmaid [saying] assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne. and now behold adonijah reigneth and thou my lord the king knowest it not and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called.  and thou my lord the king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. otherwise it will come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders. and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet came in. and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet. and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they are eating and drinking before him and say [long] live king adonijah. but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called.  is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him  then king david answered and said call to me bathsheba. and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king. and the king sware and said as jehovah liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity verily as i sware unto thee by jehovah the god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead verily so will i do this day. then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did obeisance to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever. and king david said call to me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada. and they came before the king. and the king said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye the trumpet and say [long] live king solomon.  then ye shall come up after him and he shall come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be prince over israel and over judah.  and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen jehovah the god of my lord the king say so [too]. as jehovah hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david. so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to gihon. and zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed solomon. and they blew the trumpet and all the people said [long] live king solomon. and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them. and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar  while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said come in for thou art a worthy man and bringest good tidings.  and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again. this is the noise that ye have heard. and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king david saying thy god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed. and also thus said the king blessed be jehovah the god of israel who hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it. and all the guests of adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way.  and adonijah feared because of solomon and he arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword. and solomon said if he shall show himself a worthy man there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness be found in him he shall die. so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar. and he came and did obeisance to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thy house. now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i am going the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of jehovah thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes [and] his commandments and his ordinances and his testimonies according to that which is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.  that jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel. moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did unto me even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet. do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to sheol in peace. but show kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled from absalom thy brother. and behold there is with thee shimei the son of gera the benjamite of bahurim who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at the jordan and i sware to him by jehovah saying i will not put thee to death with the sword.  now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to sheol with blood. and david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david. and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem. and solomon sat upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly. then adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon. and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably. he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee. and she said say on. and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from jehovah. and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not. and she said unto him say on. and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife.  and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king. bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah. and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a throne to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right hand. then she said i ask one small petition of thee deny me not. and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not deny thee. and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife. and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah. then king solomon sware by jehovah saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life. now therefore as jehovah liveth who hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me a house as he promised surely adonijah shall be put to death this day.  and king solomon sent by benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him so that he died. and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord jehovah before david my father and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto jehovah that he might fulfil the word of jehovah which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh. and the tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom. and joab fled unto the tent of jehovah and caught hold on the horns of the altar. and it was told king solomon joab is fled unto the tent of jehovah and behold he is by the altar. then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him. and benaiah came to the tent of jehovah and said unto him thus saith the king come forth. and he said nay but i will die here. and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me.  and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the blood which joab shed without cause from me and from my fathers house. and jehovah will return his blood upon his own head because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword and my father david knew it not [to wit] abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah. so shall their blood return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but unto david and unto his seed and unto his house and unto his throne shall there be peace for ever from jehovah. then benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar. and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee a house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither.  for on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head. and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do. and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days. and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maacah king of gath. and they told shimei saying behold thy servants are in gath. and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath. and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again. and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not adjure thee by jehovah and protest unto thee saying know for certain that on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the saying that i have heard is good. why then hast thou not kept the oath of jehovah and the commandment that i have charged thee with  the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. but king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before jehovah for ever. so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada and he went out and fell upon him so that he died. and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon. and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of jehovah and the wall of jerusalem round about. only the people sacrificed in the high places because there was no house built for the name of jehovah until those days. and solomon loved jehovah walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar.  in gibeon jehovah appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee. and solomon said thou hast showed unto thy servant david my father great lovingkindness according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day. and now o jehovah my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in. and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and evil for who is able to judge this thy great people and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing.  and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice behold i have done according to thy word lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there hath been none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days. and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of jehovah and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants. then there came two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him.  and the one woman said oh my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house. and it came to pass the third day after i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house. and this womans child died in the night because she lay upon it. and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom. and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had looked at it in the morning behold it was not my son whom i did bear. and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son. and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son. thus they spake before the king. then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living. and the king said fetch me a sword. and they brought a sword before the king.  and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other. then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her heart yearned over her son and she said oh my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it. but the other said it shall be neither mine nor thine divide it. then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof. and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do justice. and king solomon was king over all israel. and these were the princes whom he had azariah the son of zadok the priest elihoreph and ahijah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were priests and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was chief minister [and] the kings friend and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the men subject to taskwork.  and solomon had twelve officers over all israel who provided victuals for the king and his household each man had to make provision for a month in the year. and these are their names ben hur in the hill country of ephraim bendeker in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbeth hanan benhesed in arubboth to him [pertained] socoh and all the land of hepher benabinadab in all the height of dor he had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife baana the son of ahilud in taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is beside zarethan beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah as far as beyond jokmeam bengeber in ramothgilead to him [pertained] the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead [even] to him [pertained] the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars ahinadab the son of iddo in mahanaim ahimaaz in naphtali he also took basemath the daughter of solomon to wife baana the son of hushai in asher and bealoth jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar shimei the son of ela in benjamin  geber the son of uri in the land of gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and [he was] the only officer that was in the land. judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry. and solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought tribute and served solomon all the days of his life. and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and a hundred sheep besides harts and gazelles and roebucks and fatted fowl. for he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the river from tiphsah even to gaza over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him. and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beer sheba all the days of solomon. and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen.  and those officers provided victuals for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomons table every man in his month they let nothing be lacking. barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where [the officers] were every man according to his charge. and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore. and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of egypt. for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and calcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all the nations round about. and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five. and he spake of trees from the cedar that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of birds and of creeping things and of fishes. and there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.  and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david. and solomon sent to hiram saying thou knowest how that david my father could not build a house for the name of jehovah his god for the wars which were about him on every side until jehovah put them under the soles of his feet. but now jehovah my god hath given me rest on every side there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence. and behold i purpose to build a house for the name of jehovah my god as jehovah spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build the house for my name. now therefore command thou that they cut me cedartrees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and i will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knoweth how to cut timber like unto the sidonians.  and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be jehovah this day who hath given unto david a wise son over this great people. and hiram sent to solomon saying i have heard [the message] which thou hast sent unto me i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir. my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be broken up there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household. so hiram gave solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire. and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year. and jehovah gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together. and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men.  and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.  and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains besides solomons chief officers that were over the work three thousand and three hundred who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. and the king commanded and they hewed out great stones costly stones to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone. and solomons builders and hirams builders and the gebalites did fashion them and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house. and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month ziv which is the second month that he began to build the house of jehovah.  and the house which king solomon built for jehovah the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty [cubits] and the height thereof thirty cubits. and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house [and] ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.  and for the house he made windows of fixed latticework. and against the wall of the house he built stories round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made side chambers round about. the nethermost story was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house round about that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls of the house. and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready at the quarry and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building.  the door for the middle side chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story] and out of the middle into the third. so he built the house and finished it and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. and he built the stories against all the house each five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. and the word of jehovah came to solomon saying concerning this house which thou art building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute mine ordinances and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i establish my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father. and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel. so solomon built the house and finished it. and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.  and he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls [of the ceiling] he built [them] for it within for an oracle even for the most holy place. and the house that is the temple before [the oracle] was forty cubits [long]. and there was cedar on the house within carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen. and he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of jehovah. and within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and he covered the altar with cedar. so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold. and the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold. and in the oracle he made two cherubim of olivewood each ten cubits high.  and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub. and he set the cherubim within the inner house and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. and he overlaid the cherubim with gold. and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers within and without. and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and without. and for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood the lintel [and] doorposts were a fifth part [of the wall].  so [he made] two doors of olive wood and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and he spread the gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees. so also made he for the entrance of the temple doorposts of olivewood out of a fourth part [of the wall] and two doors of firwood the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding. and he carved [thereon] cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. and he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone and a course of cedar beams. in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of jehovah laid in the month ziv. and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it. so was he seven years in building it. and solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house.  for he built the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was a hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars. and it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams that were upon the pillars fifteen in a row. and there were beams in three rows and window was over against window in three ranks. and all the doors and posts were made square with beams and window was over against window in three ranks. and he made the porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and a porch before them and pillars and a threshold before them. and he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. and his house where he was to dwell the other court within the porch was of the like work. he made also a house for pharaohs daughter whom solomon had taken to wife like unto this porch.  all these were of costly stones even of hewn stone according to measure sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside unto the great court. and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. and above were costly stones even hewn stone according to measure and cedarwood. and the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone and a course of cedar beams like as the inner court of the house of jehovah and the porch of the house. and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre. he was the son of a widow of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in brass. and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work. for he fashioned the two pillars of brass eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.  and he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits. there were nets of checkerwork and wreaths of chainwork for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. so he made the pillars and there were two rows round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars and so did he for the other capital. and the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work four cubits. and there were capitals above also upon the two pillars close by the belly which was beside the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital. and he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz. and upon the top of the pillars was lilywork so was the work of the pillars finished.  and he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and the height thereof was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about. and under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it for ten cubits compassing the sea round about the knops were in two rows cast when it was cast. it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set upon them above and all their hinder parts were inward. and it was a handbreadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it held two thousand baths. and he made the ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it. and the work of the bases was on this manner they had panels and there were panels between the ledges and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubim and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.  and every base had four brazen wheels and axles of brass and the four feet thereof had undersetters beneath the laver were the undersetters molten with wreaths at the side of each. and the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal a cubit and a half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings and their panels were foursquare not round. and the four wheels were underneath the panels and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their felloes and their spokes and their naves were all molten. and there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base the undersetters thereof were of the base itself. and in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.  and on the plates of the stays thereof and on the panels thereof he graved cherubim lions and palm trees according to the space of each with wreaths round about. after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one form. and he made ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon very one of the ten bases one laver. and he set the bases five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south. and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basins. so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king solomon in the house of jehovah the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars and the ten bases and the ten lavers on the bases  and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea and the pots and the shovels and the basins even all these vessels which hiram made for king solomon in the house of jehovah were of burnished brass. in the plain of the jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarethan. and solomon left all the vessels [unweighed] because they were exceeding many the weight of the brass could not be found out. and solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of jehovah the golden altar and the table whereupon the showbread was of gold and the candlesticks five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle of pure gold and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and the cups and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the firepans of pure gold and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house [to wit] of the temple of gold.  thus all the work that king solomon wrought in the house of jehovah was finished. and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated [even] the silver and the gold and the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of jehovah. then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers [houses] of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of jehovah out of the city of david which is zion. and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month. and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark. and they brought up the ark of jehovah and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent even these did the priests and the levites bring up. and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.  and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of jehovah unto its place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim. for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. and the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle but they were not seen without and there they are unto this day. there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when jehovah made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt. and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of jehovah so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of jehovah filled the house of jehovah. then spake solomon jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. i have surely built thee a house of habitation a place for thee to dwell in for ever. and the king turned his face about and blessed all the assembly of israel and all the assembly of israel stood.  and he said blessed be jehovah the god of israel who spake with his mouth unto david thy father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house that my name might be there but i chose david to be over my people israel. now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of jehovah the god of israel. but jehovah said unto david my father whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name thou didst well that it was in thy heart nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name. and jehovah hath established his word that he spake for i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as jehovah promised and have built the house for the name of jehovah the god of israel. and there have i set a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of jehovah which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt.  and solomon stood before the altar of jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and he said o jehovah the god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart who hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou didst promise him yea thou spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand as it is this day. now therefore o jehovah the god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only thy children take heed to their way to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. now therefore o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father. but will god in very deed dwell on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded  yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o jehovah my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place whereof thou hast said my name shall be there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place yea hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and when thou hearest forgive. if a man sin against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and he come [and] swear before thine altar in this house then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness. when thy people israel are smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee if they turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house  then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence if there be blasting [or] mildew locust [or] caterpillar if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man [or] by all thy people israel who shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house  then hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and forgive and do and render unto every man according to all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. moreover concerning the foreigner that is not of thy people israel when he shall come out of a far country for thy names sake for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy mighty hand and of thine outstretched arm when he shall come and pray toward this house hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as doth thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have built is called by my name. if thy people go out to battle against their enemy by whatsoever way thou shalt send them and they pray unto jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name  then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause.  if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy far off or near yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn again and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have dealt wickedly if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwellingplace and maintain their cause  and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before those who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them for they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron  that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee. for thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord jehovah. and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto jehovah he arose from before the altar of jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. and he stood and blessed all the assembly of israel with a loud voice saying  blessed be jehovah that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by moses his servant. jehovah our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers. and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before jehovah be nigh unto jehovah our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel as every day shall require that all the peoples of the earth may know that jehovah he is god there is none else. let your heart therefore be perfect with jehovah our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day. and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before jehovah.  and solomon offered for the sacrifice of peaceofferings which he offered unto jehovah two and twenty thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of jehovah. the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of jehovah for there he offered the burntoffering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings because the brazen altar that was before jehovah was too little to receive the burntoffering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings. so solomon held the feast at that time and all israel with him a great assembly from the entrance of hamath unto the brook of egypt before jehovah our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days. on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that jehovah had showed unto david his servant and to israel his people.  and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of jehovah and the kings house and all solomons desire which he was pleased to do that jehovah appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon. and jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom over israel for ever according as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel. but if ye shall turn away from following me ye or your children and not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but shall go and serve other gods and worship them  then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. and though this house is so high yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath jehovah done thus unto this land and to this house and they shall answer because they forsook jehovah their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath jehovah brought all this evil upon them. and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the two houses the house of jehovah and the kings house now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedartrees and firtrees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee. and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not.  and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day. and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised to build the house of jehovah and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer. pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a portion unto his daughter solomons wife. and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether and baalath and tamar in the wilderness in the land and all the store cities that solomon had and the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion. as for all the people that were left of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites who were not of the children of israel  their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel were not able utterly to destroy of them did solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day. but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondservants but they were the men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. these were the chief officers that were over solomons work five hundred and fifty who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which [solomon] had built for her then did he build millo. and three times a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peaceofferings upon the altar which he built unto jehovah burning incense therewith [upon the altar] that was before jehovah. so he finished the house. and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom. and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon.  and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon. and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of jehovah she came to prove him with hard questions. and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart. and solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not. and when the queen of sheba had seen all the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of jehovah there was no more spirit in her. and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom. howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which i heard.  happy are thy men happy are these thy servants that stand continually before thee [and] that hear thy wisdom. blessed be jehovah thy god who delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because jehovah loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do justice and righteousness. and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon. and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones. and the king made of the almugtrees pillars for the house of jehovah and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for the singers there came no such almugtrees nor were seen unto this day. and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked besides that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty. so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants.  now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold besides [that which] the traders [brought] and the traffic of the merchants and of all the kings of the mingled people and of the governors of the country. and king solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler. and [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold three pounds of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon. moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold. there were six steps to the throne and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the stays. and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom. and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon.  for the king had at sea a navy of tarshish with the navy of hiram once every three years came the navy of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks. so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. and all the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart. and they brought every man his tribute vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment and armor and spices horses and mules a rate year by year. and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem. and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance. and the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt and the kings merchants received them in droves each drove at a price.  and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means. now king solomon loved many foreign women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites sidonians and hittites of the nations concerning which jehovah said unto the children of israel ye shall not go among them neither shall they come among you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love. and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart. for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with jehovah his god as was the heart of david his father. for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites.  and solomon did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and went not fully after jehovah as did david his father. then did solomon build a high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the mount that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon. and so did he for all his foreign wives who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. and jehovah was angry with solomon because his heart was turned away from jehovah the god of israel who had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which jehovah commanded. wherefore jehovah said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant. notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son.  howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but i will give one tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake which i have chosen. and jehovah raised up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the kings seed in edom. for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain and had smitten every male in edom for joab and all israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in edom that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child. and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt who gave him a house and appointed him victuals and gave him land. and hadad found great favor in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen. and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs house among the sons of pharaoh.  and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country. then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit only let me depart. and god raised up [another] adversary unto him rezon the son of eliada who had fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah. and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a troop when david slew them [of zobah] and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus. and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon besides the mischief that hadad [did] and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria. and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephraimite of zeredah a servant of solomon whose mothers name was zeruah a widow he also lifted up his hand against the king. and this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breach of the city of david his father.  and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valor and solomon saw the young man that he was industrious and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of joseph. and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way now [ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field. and ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces. and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith jehovah the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians chemosh the god of moab and milcom the god of the children of ammon and they have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and [to keep] my statutes and mine ordinances as did david his father.  howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants sake whom i chose who kept my commandments and my statutes but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes. and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a lamp alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there. and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel. and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that which is right in mine eyes to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and will build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee. and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever. solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam but jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon.  now the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years. and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king. and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of it for he was yet in egypt whither he had fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  and they sent and called him that jeroboam and all the assembly of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee. and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me. and the people departed. and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people  and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever. but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him that stood before him. and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou speak unto them my little finger is thicker than my fathers loins.  and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions. so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king bade saying come to me again the third day.  and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions. so the king hearkened not unto the people for it was a thing brought about of jehovah that he might establish his word which jehovah spake by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat. and when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david. so israel departed unto their tents.  but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them. then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the men subject to taskwork and all israel stoned him to death with stones. and king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem. so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day.  and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was returned that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only. and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon. but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the rest of the people saying thus saith jehovah ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is of me. so they hearkened unto the word of jehovah and returned and went their way according to the word of jehovah. then jeroboam built shechem in the hillcountry of ephraim and dwelt therein and he went out from thence and built penuel.  and jeroboam said in his heart now will the kingdom return to the house of david if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of jehovah at jerusalem then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they will kill me and return to rehoboam king of judah. whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and he said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt. and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan. and this thing became a sin for the people went [to worship] before the one even unto dan. and he made houses of high places and made priests from among all the people that were not of the sons of levi. and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he went up unto the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.  and he went up unto the altar which he had made in bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and he ordained a feast for the children of israel and went up unto the altar to burn incense. and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of jehovah unto bethel and jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. and he cried against the altar by the word of jehovah and said o altar altar thus saith jehovah behold a son shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall they burn upon thee. and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which jehovah hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. and it came to pass when the king heard the saying of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel that jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him. and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not draw it back again to him.  the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of jehovah. and the king answered and said unto the man of god entreat now the favor of jehovah thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again. and the man of god entreated jehovah and the kings hand was restored him again and became as it was before. and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward. and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thy house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place for so was it charged me by the word of jehovah saying thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water neither return by the way that thou camest. so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel. now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them also they told unto their father.  and their father said unto them what way went he now his sons had seen what way the man of god went that came from judah. and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass. so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon. and he went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am. then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread. and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by the word of jehovah thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. and he said unto him i also am a prophet as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of jehovah saying bring him back with thee into thy house that he may eat bread and drink water. [but] he lied unto him. so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water. and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back  and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith jehovah forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of jehovah and hast not kept the commandment which jehovah thy god commanded thee but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass [to wit] for the prophet whom he had brought back. and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his body was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the body. and behold men passed by and saw the body cast in the way and the lion standing by the body and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.  and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the mouth of jehovah therefore jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of jehovah which he spake unto him. and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass. and they saddled it. and he went and found his body cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the body the lion had not eaten the body nor torn the ass. and the prophet took up the body of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him. and he laid his body in his own grave and they mourned over him [saying] alas my brother and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones. for the saying which he cried by the word of jehovah against the altar in beth el and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass.  after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again from among all the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him that there might be priests of the high places. and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth. at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick. and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet who spake concerning me that i should be king over this people. and take with thee ten loaves and cakes and a cruse of honey and go to him he will tell thee what shall become of the child. and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah. now ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age. and jehovah said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it will be when she cometh in that she will feign herself to be another woman.  and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings. go tell jeroboam thus saith jehovah the god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes but hast done evil above all that were before thee and hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam every manchild him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel and will utterly sweep away the house of jeroboam as a man sweepeth away dung till it be all gone.  him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat for jehovah hath spoken it. arise thou therefore get thee to thy house [and] when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die. and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward jehovah the god of israel in the house of jeroboam. moreover jehovah will raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now. for jehovah will smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he will root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and will scatter them beyond the river because they have made their asherim provoking jehovah to anger. and he will give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam which he hath sinned and wherewith he hath made israel to sin. and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah [and] as she came to the threshold of the house the child died.  and all israel buried him and mourned for him according to the word of jehovah which he spake by his servant ahijah the prophet. and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel. and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead. and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah. rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess. and judah did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed above all that their fathers had done. for they also built them high places and pillars and asherim on every high hill and under every green tree  and there were also sodomites in the land they did according to all the abominations of the nations which jehovah drove out before the children of israel. and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and he took away the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made. and king rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the kings house. and it was so that as oft as the king went into the house of jehovah the guard bare them and brought them back into the guardchamber. now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam continually. and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess. and abijam his son reigned in his stead.  now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat began abijam to reign over judah. three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom. and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with jehovah his god as the heart of david his father. nevertheless for davids sake did jehovah his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem because david did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite. now there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life. and the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam. and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead. and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel began asa to reign over judah.  and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom. and asa did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah as did david his father. and he put away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. and also maacah his mother he removed from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and burnt it at the brook kidron. but the high places were not taken away nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect with jehovah all his days. and he brought into the house of jehovah the things that his father had dedicated and the things that himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels. and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days. and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to asa king of judah.  then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to ben hadad the son of tabrimmon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying [there is] a league between me and thee between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me. and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abel bethmaacah and all chinneroth with all the land of naphtali. and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building ramah and dwelt in tirzah. then king asa made a proclamation unto all judah none was exempted and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built therewith geba of benjamin and mizpah.  now the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah but in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and he reigned over israel two years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin. and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel were laying siege to gibbethon. even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead.  and it came to pass that as soon as he was king he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of jehovah which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite for the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and wherewith he made israel to sin because of his provocation wherewith he provoked jehovah the god of israel to anger. now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days. in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah [and reigned] twenty and four years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin. and the word of jehovah came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying  forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins behold i will utterly sweep away baasha and his house and i will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat. him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat. now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead. and moreover by the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of jehovah against baasha and against his house both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he smote him. in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah [and reigned] two years.  and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him. now he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza who was over the household in tirzah  and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead. and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he smote all the house of baasha he left him not a single manchild neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends. thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of jehovah which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son which they sinned and wherewith they made israel to sin to provoke jehovah the god of israel to anger with their vanities. now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah. now the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines.  and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also smitten the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp.  and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah. and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the castle of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of jehovah in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin. now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri. but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned. in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel [and reigned] twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah.  and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and he built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer the owner of the hill samaria. and omri did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and dealt wickedly above all that were before him. for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sins wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke jehovah the god of israel to anger with their vanities. now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he showed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead. and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years. and ahab the son of omri did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah above all that were before him.  and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the sidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him. and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria. and ahab made the asherah and ahab did yet more to provoke jehovah the god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him. in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son segub according to the word of jehovah which he spake by joshua the son of nun. and elijah the tishbite who was of the sojourners of gilead said unto ahab as jehovah the god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word. and the word of jehovah came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before the jordan.  and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. so he went and did according unto the word of jehovah for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before the jordan. and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook. and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land. and the word of jehovah came unto him saying arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to sidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow there to sustain thee. so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widow was there gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink. and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand.  and she said as jehovah thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die. and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it forth unto me and afterward make for thee and for thy son. for thus saith jehovah the god of israel the jar of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth. and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat [many] days. the jar of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of jehovah which he spake by elijah. and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him. and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance and to slay my son  and he said unto her give me thy son. and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he abode and laid him upon his own bed. and he cried unto jehovah and said o jehovah my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto jehovah and said o jehovah my god i pray thee let this childs soul come into him again. and jehovah hearkened unto the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived. and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth. and the woman said to elijah now i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of jehovah in thy mouth is truth. and it came to pass after many days that the word of jehovah came to elijah in the third year saying go show thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth. and elijah went to show himself unto ahab. and the famine was sore in samaria.  and ahab called obadiah who was over the household. now obadiah feared jehovah greatly for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of jehovah that obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water. and ahab said unto obadiah go through the land unto all the fountains of water and unto all the brooks peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts. so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself. and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said is it thou my lord elijah and he answered him it is i go tell thy lord behold elijah [is here]. and he said wherein have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me as jehovah thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not here he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not. and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah [is here].  and it will come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of jehovah will carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he will slay me but i thy servant fear jehovah from my youth. was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of jehovah how i hid a hundred men of jehovahs prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah [is here] and he will slay me. and elijah said as jehovah of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely show myself unto him today. so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah. and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him is it thou thou troubler of israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of jehovah and thou hast followed the baalim.  now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the asherah four hundred that eat at jezebels table. so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel. and elijah came near unto all the people and said how long go ye limping between the two sides if jehovah be god follow him but if baal then follow him. and the people answered him not a word. then said elijah unto the people i even i only am left a prophet of jehovah but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men. let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on the wood and put no fire under. and call ye on the name of your god and i will call on the name of jehovah and the god that answereth by fire let him be god. and all the people answered and said it is well spoken.  and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your god but put no fire under. and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us. but there was no voice nor any that answered. and they leaped about the altar which was made. and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is musing or he is gone aside or he is on a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked. and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances till the blood gushed out upon them. and it was so when midday was past that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation but there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded. and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him. and he repaired the altar of jehovah that was thrown down.  and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of jehovah came saying israel shall be thy name. and with the stones he built an altar in the name of jehovah and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed. and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid it on the wood. and he said fill four jars with water and pour it on the burntoffering and on the wood. and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time. and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time. and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water. and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation that elijah the prophet came near and said o jehovah the god of abraham of isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word. hear me o jehovah hear me that this people may know that thou jehovah art god and [that] thou hast turned their heart back again.  then the fire of jehovah fell and consumed the burntoffering and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench. and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said jehovah he is god jehovah he is god. and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape. and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there. and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain. so ahab went up to eat and to drink. and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he bowed himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees. and he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea. and he went up and looked and said there is nothing. and he said go again seven times. and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a cloud out of the sea as small as a mans hand. and he said go up say unto ahab make ready [thy chariot] and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.  and it came to pass in a little while that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain. and ahab rode and went to jezreel and the hand of jehovah was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel. and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. then jezebel send a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beer sheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there. but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a junipertree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o jehovah take away my life for i am not better than my fathers. and he lay down and slept under a junipertree and behold an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat.  and he looked and behold there was at his head a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water. and he did eat and drink and laid him down again. and the angel of jehovah came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee. and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god. and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of jehovah came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah and he said i have been very jealous for jehovah the god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away. and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before jehovah. and behold jehovah passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before jehovah but jehovah was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but jehovah was not in the earthquake  and after the earthquake a fire but jehovah was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice. and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah and he said i have been very jealous for jehovah the god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away. and jehovah said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest thou shalt anoint hazael to be king over syria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth from the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay. yet will i leave [me] seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him.  so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke [of oxen] before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed over unto him and cast his mantle upon him. and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee. and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee and he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat. then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him. and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and fought against it. and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine. and the king of israel answered and said it is according to thy saying my lord o king i am thine and all that i have.  and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh ben hadad saying i sent indeed unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children but i will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time and they shall search thy house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away. then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not. and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken thou not neither consent. wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do. and the messengers departed and brought him word again. and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.  and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on [his armor] boast himself as he that putteth it off. and it came to pass when [ben hadad] heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set [yourselves in array]. and they set [themselves in array] against the city. and behold a prophet came near unto ahab king of israel and said thus saith jehovah hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thy hand this day and thou shalt know that i am jehovah.  and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith jehovah by the young men of the princes of the provinces. then he said who shall begin the battle and he answered thou. then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirtytwo and after them he mustered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand. and they went out at noon. but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him.  and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and ben hadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out from samaria. and he said whether they are come out for peace take them alive or whether they are come out for war taken them alive. so these went out of the city the young men of the princes of the provinces and the army which followed them. and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and ben hadad the king of syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.  and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter. and the prophet came near to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee. and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their god is a god of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they. and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their room  and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they. and he hearkened unto their voice and did so. and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad mustered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel. and the children of israel were mustered and were victualled and went against them and the children of israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country. and a man of god came near and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith jehovah because the syrians have said jehovah is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thy hand and ye shall know that i am jehovah.  and they encamped one over against the other seven days. and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.  but the rest fled to aphek into the city and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber. and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us we pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life. so they girded sackcloth on their loins and [put] ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant ben hadad saith i pray thee let me live. and he said is he yet alive he is my brother. now the men observed diligently and hasted to catch whether it were his mind and they said thy brother ben hadad. then he said go ye bring him. then ben hadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot. and [benhadad] said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria. and i [said ahab] will let thee go with this covenant. so he made a covenant with him and let him go.  and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of jehovah smite me i pray thee. and the man refused to smite him. then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of jehovah behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee. and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him. then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee. and the man smote him smiting and wounding him. so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone. and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it. and he hasted and took the headband away from his eyes and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.  and he said unto him thus saith jehovah because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom i had devoted to destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people. and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria. and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria. and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money. and naboth said to ahab jehovah forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread. but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread  and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee [another] vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard. and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thy heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite. so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city [and] that dwelt with naboth. and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people and set two men base fellows before him and let them bear witness against him saying thou didst curse god and the king. and then carry him out and stone him to death. and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people.  and the two men the base fellows came in and sat before him and the base fellows bare witness against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did curse god and the king. then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him to death with stones. then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead. and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead. and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it. and the word of jehovah came to elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet ahab king of israel who dwelleth in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to take possession of it.  and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith jehovah hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith jehovah in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine. and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of jehovah. behold i will bring evil upon thee and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from ahab every man child and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel and i will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and hast made israel to sin. and of jezebel also spake jehovah saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the rampart of jezreel. him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.  but there was none like unto ahab who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of jehovah whom jezebel his wife stirred up. and he did very abominably in following idols according to all that the amorites did whom jehovah cast out before the children of israel. and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly. and the word of jehovah came to elijah the tishbite saying seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house. and they continued three years without war between syria and israel. and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel. and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramothgilead is ours and we are still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria  and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses. and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire first i pray thee for the word of jehovah. then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king. but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of jehovah besides that we may inquire of him and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of jehovah micaiah the son of imlah but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil. and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so. then the king of israel called an officer and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imlah. now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were sitting each on his throne arrayed in their robes in an open place at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus saith jehovah with these shalt thou push the syrians until they be consumed. and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak thou good. and micaiah said as jehovah liveth what jehovah saith unto me that will i speak. and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go up and prosper and jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of jehovah  and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and jehovah said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace. and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil and [micaiah] said therefore hear thou the word of jehovah i saw jehovah sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. and jehovah said who shall entice ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner. and there came forth a spirit and stood before jehovah and said i will entice him. and jehovah said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. and he said thou shalt entice him and shalt prevail also go forth and do so. now therefore behold jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.  then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of jehovah from me to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace. and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace jehovah hath not spoken by me. and he said hear ye peoples all of you. so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead. and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but put thou on thy robes. and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle. now the king of syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel.  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out. and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him. and a certain man drew his bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the armor wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thy hand and carry me out of the host for i am sore wounded. and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. and there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his country. so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria. and they washed the chariot by the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood now the harlots washed themselves [there] according unto the word of jehovah which he spake.  now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel. jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem. and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi. and he walked in all the way of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of jehovah howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel. now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he showed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father asa he put away out of the land. and there was no king in edom a deputy was king.  jehoshaphat made ships of tarshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at ezion geber. then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. but jehoshaphat would not. and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead. ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned two years over israel. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat wherein he made israel to sin. and he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger jehovah the god of israel according to all that his father had done. and moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab.  and ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this sickness. but the angel of jehovah said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it because there is no god in israel that ye go to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron now therefore thus saith jehovah thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up but shalt surely die. and elijah departed. and the messengers returned unto him and he said unto them why is it that ye are returned and they said unto him there came up a man to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith jehovah is it because there is no god in israel that thou sendest to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up but shalt surely die. and he said unto them what manner of man was he that came up to meet you and told you these words  and they answered him he was a hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. and he said it is elijah the tishbite. then [the king] sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. and he went up to him and behold he was sitting on the top of the hill. and he spake unto him o man of god the king hath said come down. and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. and again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king said come down quickly. and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.  and again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight. behold there came fire down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties but now let my life be precious in thy sight. and the angel of jehovah said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him. and he arose and went down with him unto the king. and he said unto him thus saith jehovah forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron is it because there is no god in israel to inquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up but shalt surely die. so he died according to the word of jehovah which elijah had spoken. and jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son.  now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  and it came to pass when jehovah would take up elijah by a whirlwind into heaven that elijah went with elisha from gilgal. and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for jehovah hath sent me as far as bethel. and elisha said as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee. so they went down to bethel. and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that jehovah will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace. and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for jehovah hath sent me to jericho. and he said as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee. so they came to jericho. and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came near to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that jehovah will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace.  and elijah said unto him tarry here i pray thee for jehovah hath sent me to the jordan. and he said as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee. and they two went on.  and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood over against them afar off and they two stood by the jordan. and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground. and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i am taken from thee. and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. and he said thou hast asked a hard thing [nevertheless] if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so. and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold [there appeared] a chariot of fire and horses of fire which parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces. he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the jordan.  and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is jehovah the god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they were divided hither and thither and elisha went over. and when the sons of the prophets that were at jericho over against him saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha. and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him. and they said unto him behold now there are with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest the spirit of jehovah hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. and he said ye shall not send. and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send. they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not.  and they came back to him while he tarried at jericho and he said unto them did i not say unto you go not and the men of the city said unto elisha behold we pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is bad and the land miscarrieth. and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein. and they brought it to him. and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast salt therein and said thus saith jehovah i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying. so the waters were healed unto this day according to the word of elisha which he spake. and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth young lads out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou baldhead go up thou baldhead. and he looked behind him and saw them and cursed them in the name of jehovah. and there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tare forty and two lads of them. and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria.  now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the pillar of baal that his father had made. nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin he departed not therefrom. now mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and he rendered unto the king of israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs and of a hundred thousand rams. but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel. and king jehoram went out of samaria at that time and mustered all israel. and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses. and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way of the wilderness of edom.  so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they made a circuit of seven days journey and there was no water for the host nor for the beasts that followed them. and the king of israel said alas for jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab. but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of jehovah that we may inquire of jehovah by him and one of the king of israels servants answered and said elisha the son of shaphat is here who poured water on the hands of elijah. and jehoshaphat said the word of jehovah is with him. so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him. and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. and the king of israel said unto him nay for jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab. and elisha said as jehovah of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee.  but now bring me a minstrel. and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of jehovah came upon him. and he said thus saith jehovah make this valley full of trenches. for thus saith jehovah ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water and ye shall drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts. and this is but a light thing in the sight of jehovah he will also deliver the moabites into your hand. and ye shall smite every fortified city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all fountains of water and mar every good piece of land with stones. and it came to pass in the morning about the time of offering the oblation that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water. now when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered themselves together all that were able to put on armor and upward and stood on the border. and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood  and they said this is blood the kings are surely destroyed and they have smitten each man his fellow now therefore moab to the spoil. and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them and they went forward into the land smiting the moabites. and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the fountains of water and felled all the good trees until in kir hareseth [only] they left the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it. and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword to break through unto the king of edom but they could not. then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burntoffering upon the wall. and there was great wrath against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land.  now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear jehovah and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen. and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thy handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil. then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few. and thou shalt go in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full. so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons they brought [the vessels] to her and she poured out. and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel. and he said unto her there is not a vessel more. and the oil stayed. then she came and told the man of god. and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy sons of the rest.  and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread. and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread. and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is a holy man of god that passeth by us continually. let us make i pray thee a little chamber on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a seat and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither. and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there. and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite. and when he had called her she stood before him. and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among mine own people. and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi answered verily she hath no son and her husband is old. and he said call her. and when he had called her she stood in the door.  and he said at this season when the time cometh round thou shalt embrace a son. and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thy handmaid. and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season when the time came round as elisha had said unto her. and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers. and he said unto his father my head my head. and he said to his servant carry him to his mother. and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died. and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut [the door] upon him and went out. and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the servants and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again. and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moon nor sabbath. and she said it shall be well. then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slacken me not the riding except i bid thee.  so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel. and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold yonder is the shunammite run i pray thee now to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well. and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught hold of his feet. and gehazi came near to thrust her away but the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and jehovah hath hid it from me and hath not told me. then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child. and the mother of the child said as jehovah liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee. and he arose and followed her. and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing. wherefore he returned to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked.  and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed. he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto jehovah. and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon him and the flesh of the child waxed warm. then he returned and walked in the house once to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes. and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite. so he called her. and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son. then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and she took up her son and went out. and elisha came again to gilgal. and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.  and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not. so they poured out for the men to eat. and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o man of god there is death in the pot. and they could not eat thereof. but he said then bring meal. and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat. and there was no harm in the pot. and there came a man from baal shalishah and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. and he said give unto the people that they may eat. and his servant said what should i set this before a hundred men but he said give the people that they may eat for thus saith jehovah they shall eat and shall leave thereof. so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of jehovah.  now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him jehovah had given victory unto syria he was also a mighty man of valor [but he was] a leper. and the syrians had gone out in bands and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maiden and she waited on naamans wife. and she said unto her mistress would that my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria then would he recover him of his leprosy. and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of israel. and the king of syria said go now and i will send a letter unto the king of israel. and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand [pieces] of gold and ten changes of raiment. and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying and now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.  and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy but consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. and it was so when elisha the man of god heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel. so naaman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of elisha. and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in the jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean. but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of jehovah his god and wave his hand over the place and recover the leper. are not abanah and pharpar the rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage.  and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean then went he down and dipped [himself] seven times in the jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean. and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a present of thy servant. but he said as jehovah liveth before whom i stand i will receive none. and he urged him to take it but he refused. and naaman said if not yet i pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto jehovah.  in this thing jehovah pardon thy servant when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow myself in the house of rimmon jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing. and he said unto him go in peace. so he departed from him a little way. but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared this naaman the syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought as jehovah liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him. so gehazi followed after naaman. and when naaman saw one running after him he alighted from the chariot to meet him and said is all well and he said all is well. my master hath sent me saying behold even now there are come to me from the hillcountry of ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of raiment.  and naaman said be pleased to take two talents. and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of raiment and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him. and when he came to the hill he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed. but he went in and stood before his master. and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither. and he said unto him went not my heart [with thee] when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and men servants and maidservants the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever. and he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow. and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us. let us go we pray thee unto the jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell. and he answered go ye.  and one said be pleased i pray thee to go with thy servants. and he answered i will go. so he went with them. and when they came to the jordan they cut down wood. but as one was felling a beam the axehead fell into the water and he cried and said alas my master for it was borrowed. and the man of god said where fell it and he showed him the place. and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and made the iron to swim. and he said take it up to thee. so he put out his hand and took it. now the king of syria was warring against israel and he took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp. and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are coming down. and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and he saved himself there not once nor twice.  and the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of israel  and one of his servants said nay my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. and he said go and see where he is that i may send and fetch him. and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan. therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about. and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that are with us are more than they that are with them. and elisha prayed and said jehovah i pray thee open his eyes that he may see. and jehovah opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha.  and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto jehovah and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness. and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha.  and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek. and he led them to samaria. and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said jehovah open the eyes of these men that they may see. and jehovah opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria. and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them and he answered thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master. and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master. and the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel. and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria.  and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore [pieces] of silver and the fourth part of a kab of doves dung for five [pieces] of silver. and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king. and he said if jehovah do not help thee whence shall i help thee out of the threshing floor or out of the winepress and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son to morrow. so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son. and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes now he was passing by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. then he said god do so to me and more also if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day.  but elisha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him and [the king] sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold the door fast against him is not the sound of his masters feet behind him and while he was yet talking with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of jehovah why should i wait for jehovah any longer and elisha said hear ye the word of jehovah thus saith jehovah tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be [sold] for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria. then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if jehovah should make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof. now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die  if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also. now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die. and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the syrians behold there was no man there. for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us. wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life. and when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and they came back and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it.  then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light punishment will overtake us now therefore come let us go and tell the kings household. so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but the horses tied and the asses tied and the tents as they were. and he called the porters and they told it to the kings household within. and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now show you what the syrians have done to us. they know that we are hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall take them alive and get into the city. and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are consumed and let us send and see.  they took therefore two chariots with horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see. and they went after them unto the jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste. and the messengers returned and told the king. and the people went out and plundered the camp of the syrians. so a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of jehovah. and the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trod upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him. and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria  and that captain answered the man of god and said now behold if jehovah should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof it came to pass even so unto him for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died. now elisha had spoken unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thy household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for jehovah hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years. and the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years. and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. now the king was talking with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done.  and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land. and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life. and when the king asked the woman she told him. so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now. and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither. and the king said unto hazael take a present in thy hand and go meet the man of god and inquire of jehovah by him saying shall i recover of this sickness so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this sickness  and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou shalt surely recover howbeit jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die. and he settled his countenance stedfastly [upon him] until he was ashamed and the man of god wept. and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strongholds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash in pieces their little ones and rip up their women with child. and hazael said but what is thy servant who is but a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over syria. then he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou wouldest surely recover. and it came to pass on the morrow that he took the coverlet and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead.  and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign. thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem. and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah. howbeit jehovah would not destroy judah for david his servants sake as he promised him to give unto him a lamp for his children alway. in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves. then joram passed over to zair and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites that compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled to their tents. so edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day. then did libnah revolt at the same time. and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign. two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem. and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel. and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah as did the house of ahab for he was the soninlaw of the house of ahab. and he went with joram the son of ahab to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram. and king joram returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria. and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick. and elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this vial of oil in thy hand and go to ramothgilead.  and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber. then take the vial of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith jehovah i have anointed thee king over israel. then open the door and flee and tarry not. so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead. and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain. and jehu said unto which of us all and he said to thee o captain. and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith jehovah the god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of jehovah even over israel. and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of jehovah at the hand of jezebel. for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab every man child and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel.  and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah. and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her. and he opened the door and fled. then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and what his talk was. and they said it is false tell us now. and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith jehovah i have anointed thee king over israel. then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew the trumpet saying jehu is king. so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram. now joram was keeping ramoth gilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria  but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria. and jehu said if this be your mind then let none escape and go forth out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel. so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there. and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram. now the watchman was standing on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company. and joram said take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me. and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not back. then he sent out a second on horseback who came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me.  and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not back and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously. and joram said make ready. and they made ready his chariot. and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out to meet jehu and found him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite. and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah. and jehu drew his bow with his full strength and smote joram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot. then said [jehu] to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father jehovah laid this burden upon him  surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith jehovah and i will requite thee in this plat saith jehovah. now therefore take and cast him into the plat [of ground] according to the word of jehovah. but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the gardenhouse. and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot [and they smote him] at the ascent of gur which is by ibleam. and he fled to megiddo and died there. and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david. and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah. and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her eyes and attired her head and looked out at the window. and as jehu entered in at the gate she said is it peace thou zimri thy masters murderer and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.  and he said throw her down. so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trod her under foot. and when he was come in he did eat and drink and he said see now to this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter. and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. wherefore they came back and told him. and he said this is the word of jehovah which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of jezebel and the body of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel. now ahab had seventy sons in samaria. and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel even the elders and unto them that brought up [the sons of] ahab saying and now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fortified city also and armor  look ye out the best and meetest of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house. but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold the two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand and he that was over the household and he that was over the city the elders also and they that brought up [the children] sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any man king do thou that which is good in thine eyes. then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be on my side and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time. now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city who brought them up. and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the kings sons and slew them even seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them unto him to jezreel.  and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the kings sons. and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning. and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye are righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who smote all these know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of jehovah which jehovah spake concerning the house of ahab for jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah. so jehu smote all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his familiar friends and his priests until he left him none remaining. and he arose and departed and went to samaria. and as he was at the shearinghouse of the shepherds in the way  jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.  and he said take them alive. and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearinghouse even two and forty men neither left he any of them. and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is. if it be give me thy hand. and he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot. and he said come with me and see my zeal for jehovah. so they made him ride in his chariot. and when he came to samaria he smote all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the word of jehovah which he spake to elijah. and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu will serve him much. now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his worshippers and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great sacrifice [to do] to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live. but jehu did it in subtlety to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal.  and jehu said sanctify a solemn assembly for baal. and they proclaimed it. and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that came not. and they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was filled from one end to another. and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal. and he brought them forth vestments. and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal and he said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of jehovah but the worshippers of baal only. and they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. now jehu had appointed him fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom i bring into your hands escape [he that letteth him go] his life shall be for the life of him.  and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burntoffering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and slay them let none come forth. and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal.  and they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of baal and burned them. and they brake down the pillar of baal and brake down the house of baal and made it a draughthouse unto this day. thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel. howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin jehu departed not from after them [to wit] the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan. and jehovah said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes [and] hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in my heart thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel. but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of jehovah the god of israel with all his heart he departed not from the sins of jeroboam wherewith he made israel to sin.  in those days jehovah began to cut off from israel and hazael smote them in all the borders of israel from the jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the valley of the arnon even gilead and bashan. now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria. and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years. now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain even him and his nurse [and put them] in the bedchamber and they hid him from athaliah so that he was not slain and he was with her hid in the house of jehovah six years. and athaliah reigned over the land.  and in the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the carites and of the guard and brought them to him into the house of jehovah and he made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of jehovah and showed them the kings son. and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that come in on the sabbath shall be keepers of the watch of the kings house and a third part shall be at the gate sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house and be a barrier. and the two companies of you even all that go forth on the sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of jehovah about the king. and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranks let him be slain and be ye with the king when he goeth out and when he cometh in.  and the captains over hundreds did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest. and the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of jehovah. and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house by the king round about. then he brought out the kings son and put the crown upon him and [gave him] the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said [long] live the king. and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and of] the people she came to the people into the house of jehovah and she looked and behold the king stood by the pillar as the manner was and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. then athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason  and jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth between the ranks and him that followeth her slay with the sword. for the priest said let her not be slain in the house of jehovah. so they made way for her and she went by the way of the horses entry to the kings house and there was she slain. and jehoiada made a covenant between jehovah and the king and the people that they should be jehovahs people between the king also and the people. and all the people of the land went to the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars. and the priest appointed officers over the house of jehovah. and he took the captains over hundreds and the carites and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of jehovah and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the kings house. and he sat on the throne of the kings.  so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. and athaliah they had slain with the sword at the kings house. jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. in the seventh year of jehu began jehoash to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba. and jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him. howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of jehovah in current money the money of the persons for whom each man is rated and all the money that it cometh into any mans heart to bring into the house of jehovah let the priests take it to them every man from his acquaintance and they shall repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found. but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.  then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and for the [other] priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore take no [more] money from your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house. and the priests consented that they should take no [more] money from the people neither repair the breaches of the house. but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of jehovah and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of jehovah. and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of jehovah. and they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of jehovah and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders that wrought upon the house of jehovah  and to the masons and the hewers of stone and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of jehovah and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. but there were not made for the house of jehovah cups of silver snuffers basins trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of jehovah for they gave that to them that did the work and repaired therewith the house of jehovah. moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work for they dealt faithfully. the money for the trespass offerings and the money for the sinofferings was not brought into the house of jehovah it was the priests. then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem.  and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of jehovah and of the kings house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from jerusalem. now the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and smote joash at the house of millo [on the way] that goeth down to silla. for jozacar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead. in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria [and reigned] seventeen years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin he departed not therefrom.  and the anger of jehovah was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael continually. and jehoahaz besought jehovah and jehovah hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of israel how that the king of syria oppressed them. and jehovah gave israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime. nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam wherewith he made israel to sin but walked therein and there remained the asherah also in samaria. for he left not to jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of syria destroyed them and made them like the dust in threshing. now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead.  in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria [and reigned] sixteen years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin but he walked therein. now the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel. now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over him and said my father my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows. and he said to the king of israel put thy hand upon the bow and he put his hand [upon it]. and elisha laid his hands upon the kings hands.  and he said open the window eastward and he opened it. then elisha said shoot and he shot. and he said jehovahs arrow of victory even the arrow of victory over syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them. and he said take the arrows and he took them. and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed. and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice. and elisha died and they buried him. now the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and as soon as the man touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet. and hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz.  but jehovah was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yet. and hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his stead. and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war. three times did joash smite him and recovered the cities of israel. in the second year of joash son of joahaz king of israel began amaziah the son of joash king of judah to reign. he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddin of jerusalem. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah yet not like david his father he did according to all that joash his father had done. howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.  and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father but the children of the murderers he put not to death according to that which is written in the book of the law of moses as jehovah commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin. he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took sela by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day. then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face. and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trod down the thistle. thou hast indeed smitten edom and thy heart hath lifted thee up glory thereof and abide at home for why shouldest thou meddle to [thy] hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee  but amaziah would not hear. so jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at beth shemesh which belongeth to judah. and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent. and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits. and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of jehovah and in the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria. now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years.  now the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there. and they brought him upon horses and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david. and all the people of judah took azariah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah. he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers. in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria [and reigned] forty and one years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin. he restored the border of israel from the entrance of hamath unto the sea of the arabah according to the word of jehovah the god of israel which he spake by his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet who was of gathhepher.  for jehovah saw the affliction of israel that it was very bitter for there was none shut up nor left at large neither was there any helper for israel. and jehovah said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash. now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath [which had belonged] to judah for israel are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jeroboam slept with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zechariah his son reigned in his stead. in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign. sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jecoliah of jerusalem. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah according to all that his father amaziah had done. howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.  and jehovah smote the king so that he was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a separate house. and jotham the kings son was over the household judging the people of the land. now the rest of the acts

in the sight of jehovah as his fathers had done he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin. and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him and smote him before the people and slew him and reigned in his stead. now the rest of the acts of zechariah behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel.  this was the word of jehovah which he spake unto jehu saying thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of israel. and so it came to pass. shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned the space of a month in samaria. and menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead. now the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel.  then menahem smote tiphsah and all that were therein and the borders thereof from tirzah because they opened not to him therefore he smote it and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel [and reigned] ten years in samaria. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah he departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin.  there came against the land pul the king of assyria and menahem gave pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. and menahem exacted the money of israel even of all the mighty men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the king of assyria. so the king of assyria turned back and stayed not there in the land. now the rest of the acts of menahem and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and menahem slept with his fathers and pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son of menahem began to reign over israel

sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha the daughter of zadok. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah he did according to all that his father uzziah had done. howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. he built the upper gate of the house of jehovah. now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah in those days jehovah began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah. and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in his stead. in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign. twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he did not that which was right in the eyes of jehovah his god like david his father.  but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the nations whom jehovah cast out from before the children of israel. and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree. then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him. at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drove the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day. so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel who rise up against me. and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of jehovah and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria. and the king of assyria hearkened unto him and the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried [the people of] it captive to kir and slew rezin.  and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglath pileser king of assyria and saw the altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof. and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so did urijah the priest make it against the coming of king ahaz from damascus. and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king drew near unto the altar and offered thereon. and he burnt his burntoffering and his mealoffering and poured his drinkoffering and sprinkled the blood of his peaceofferings upon the altar. and the brazen altar which was before jehovah he brought from the forefront of the house from between his altar and the house of jehovah and put it on the north side of his altar.  and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar burn the morning burntoffering and the evening mealoffering and the kings burntoffering and his meal offering with the burntoffering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drinkofferings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burntoffering and all the blood of the sacrifice but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by. thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded. and king ahaz cut off the panels of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stone. and the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he unto the house of jehovah because of the king of assyria. now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.  in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel [and reigned] nine years. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah yet not as the kings of israel that were before him. against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and brought him tribute. and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and offered no tribute to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years. in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away unto assyria and placed them in halah and on the habor the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes. and it was so because the children of israel had sinned against jehovah their god who brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods  and walked in the statutes of the nations whom jehovah cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they made. and the children of israel did secretly things that were not right against jehovah their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city and they set them up pillars and asherim upon every high hill and under every green tree and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the nations whom jehovah carried away before them and they wrought wicked things to provoke jehovah to anger and they served idols whereof jehovah had said unto them ye shall not do this thing. yet jehovah testified unto israel and unto judah by every prophet and every seer saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets. notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their neck like to the neck of their fathers who believed not in jehovah their god.  and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified unto them and they followed vanity and became vain and [went] after the nations that were round about them concerning whom jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them. and they forsook all the commandments of jehovah their god and made them molten images even two calves and made an asherah and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal. and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger. therefore jehovah was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only. also judah kept not the commandments of jehovah their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made. and jehovah rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight.  for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drove israel from following jehovah and made them sin a great sin. and the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them until jehovah removed israel out of his sight as he spake by all his servants the prophets. so israel was carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day. and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from avva and from hamath and sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof. and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not jehovah therefore jehovah sent lions among them which killed some of them. wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast carried away and placed in the cities of samaria know not the law of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the law of the god of the land.  then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the law of the god of the land. so one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear jehovah. howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima and the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim. so they feared jehovah and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. they feared jehovah and served their own gods after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.  unto this day they do after the former manner they fear not jehovah neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law or after the commandment which jehovah commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel with whom jehovah had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them but jehovah who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm him shall ye fear and unto him shall ye bow yourselves and to him shall ye sacrifice and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods but jehovah your god shall ye fear and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner.  so these nations feared jehovah and served their graven images their children likewise and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this day. now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign. twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abi the daughter of zechariah. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah according to all that david his father had done. he removed the high places and brake the pillars and cut down the asherah and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan. he trusted in jehovah the god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor [among them] that were before him. for he clave to jehovah he departed not from following him but kept his commandments which jehovah commanded moses.  and jehovah was with him whithersoever he went forth he prospered and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not. he smote the philistines unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it. and at the end of three years they took it in the sixth year of hezekiah which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken. and the king of assyria carried israel away unto assyria and put them in halah and on the habor the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes because they obeyed not the voice of jehovah their god but transgressed his covenant even all that moses the servant of jehovah commanded and would not hear it nor do it. now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fortified cities of judah and took them.  and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear. and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. and hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of jehovah and in the treasures of the kings house. at that time did hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of jehovah and [from] the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria. and the king of assyria sent tartan and rab saris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great army unto jerusalem. and they went up and came to jerusalem. and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fullers field. and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebnah the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder.  and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest thou sayest but they are but vain words [there is] counsel and strength for the war. now on whom dost thou trust that thou hast rebelled against me now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him. but if ye say unto me we trust in jehovah our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. how then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen am i now come up without jehovah against this place to destroy it jehovah said unto me go up against this land and destroy it.  then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebnah and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words [hath he] not [sent me] to the men that sit on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear ye the word of the great king the king of assyria. thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand neither let hezekiah make you trust in jehovah saying jehovah will surely deliver us and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria. hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make your peace with me and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his figtree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern  until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olivetrees and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying jehovah will deliver us. hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of my hand that jehovah should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not.  then came eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh.  and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of jehovah. and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz. and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of contumely for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth. it may be jehovah thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to defy the living god and will rebuke the words which jehovah thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah. and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith jehovah be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me.  behold i will put a spirit in him and he shall hear tidings and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.  so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish. and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria. behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden that were in telassar where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of jehovah and spread it before jehovah.  and hezekiah prayed before jehovah and said o jehovah the god of israel that sittest [above] the cherubim thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth. incline thine ear o jehovah and hear open thine eyes o jehovah and see and hear the words of sennacherib wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living god. of a truth jehovah the kings of assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them. now therefore o jehovah our god save thou us i beseech thee out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou jehovah art god alone. then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith jehovah the god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard [thee].  this is the word that jehovah hath spoken concerning him the virgin daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. whom hast thou defied and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high [even] against the holy one of israel. by thy messengers thou hast defied the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the innermost parts of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice firtrees thereof and i will enter into his farthest lodging place the forest of his fruitful field. i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet will i dry up all the rivers of egypt. hast thou not heard how i have done it long ago and formed it of ancient times now have i brought it to pass that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.  therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as grain blasted before it is grown up. but i know thy sitting down and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me. because of thy raging against me and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. and this shall be the sign unto thee ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and out of mount zion they that shall escape the zeal of jehovah shall perform this.  therefore thus saith jehovah concerning the king of assyria he shall not come unto this city nor shoot an arrow there neither shall he come before it with shield nor cast up a mound against it. by the way that he came by the same shall he return and he shall not come unto this city saith jehovah. for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake. and it came to pass that night that the angel of jehovah went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand and when men arose early in the morning behold these were all dead bodies. so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh. and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of ararat. and esar haddon his son reigned in his stead. in those days was hezekiah sick unto death. and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith jehovah set thy house in order for thou shalt die and not live.  then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto jehovah saying remember now o jehovah i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight. and hezekiah wept sore. and it came to pass before isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city that the word of jehovah came to him saying turn back and say to hezekiah the prince of my people thus saith jehovah the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of jehovah. and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake. and isaiah said take a cake of figs. and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered. and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that jehovah will heal me and that i shall go up unto the house of jehovah the third day  and isaiah said this shall be the sign unto thee from jehovah that jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps nay but let the shadow return backward ten steps. and isaiah the prophet cried unto jehovah and he brought the shadow ten steps backward by which it had gone down on the dial of ahaz. at that time berodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick. and hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah showed them not. then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon.  and he said what have they seen in thy house and hezekiah answered all that is in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not showed them. and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of jehovah. behold the days come that all that is in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith jehovah. and of thy sons that shall issue from thee whom thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon. then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of jehovah which thou hast spoken. he said moreover is it not so if peace and truth shall be in my days now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead.  manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned five and fifty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzibah. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah after the abominations of the nations whom jehovah cast out before the children of israel. for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made an asherah as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them. and he built altars in the house of jehovah whereof jehovah said in jerusalem will i put my name. and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of jehovah. and he made his son to pass through the fire and practised augury and used enchantments and dealt with them that had familiar spirits and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger.  and he set the graven image of asherah that he had made in the house of which jehovah said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever neither will i cause the feet of israel to wander any more out of the land which i gave their fathers if only they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them. but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom jehovah destroyed before the children of israel. and jehovah spake by his servants the prophets saying because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did that were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols therefore thus saith jehovah the god of israel behold i bring such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle.  and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down. and i will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies because they have done that which is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day. moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another besides his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of jehovah. now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead.  amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah as did manasseh his father. and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them and he forsook jehovah the god of his fathers and walked not in the way of jehovah. and the servants of amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house. but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead. now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead. josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of bozkath.  and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of jehovah saying go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of jehovah which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of jehovah and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of jehovah to repair the breaches of the house unto the carpenters and to the builders and to the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house. howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand for they dealt faithfully. and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of jehovah. and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan and he read it.  and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of jehovah. and shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. and shaphan read it before the king. and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes. and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of micaiah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying go ye inquire of jehovah for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of jehovah that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.  so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asaiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the second quarter and they communed with her. and she said unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel tell ye the man that sent you unto me thus saith jehovah behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read. because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and it shall not be quenched. but unto the king of judah who sent you to inquire of jehovah thus shall ye say to him thus saith jehovah the god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard  because thy heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before jehovah when thou heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith jehovah. therefore behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which i will bring upon this place. and they brought the king word again. and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem. and the king went up to the house of jehovah and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of jehovah.  and the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before jehovah to walk after jehovah and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all [his] heart and all [his] soul to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant. and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the threshold to bring forth out of the temple of jehovah all the vessels that were made for baal and for the asherah and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of the kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel. and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heaven.  and he brought out the asherah from the house of jehovah without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and beat it to dust and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people. and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were in the house of jehovah where the women wove hangings for the asherah. and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city. nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of jehovah in jerusalem but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren. and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech.  and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entrance of the house of jehovah by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the precincts and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. and the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of jehovah did the king break down and beat [them] down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron. and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the sidonians and for chemosh the abomination of moab and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile. and he brake in pieces the pillars and cut down the asherim and filled their places with the bones of men.  moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made even that altar and the high place he brake down and he burned the high place and beat it to dust and burned the asherah. and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and defiled it according to the word of jehovah which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these things.  then he said what monument is that which i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god who came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of beth el. and he said let him be let no man move his bones. so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria. and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke [jehovah] to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in beth el.  and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and he returned to jerusalem. and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto jehovah your god as it is written in this book of the covenant. surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah  but in the eighteenth year of king josiah was this passover kept to jehovah in jerusalem. moreover them that had familiar spirits and the wizards and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of jehovah. and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him.  notwithstanding jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations wherewith manasseh had provoked him. and jehovah said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and i will cast off this city which i have chosen even jerusalem and the house of which i said my name shall be there. now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  in his days pharaohnecoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and [pharaoh necoh] slew him at megiddo when he had seen him. and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre. and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his fathers stead.  jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah according to all that his fathers had done. and pharaoh necoh put him in bonds at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. and pharaoh necoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and changed his name to jehoiakim but he took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there. and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnecoh. jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zebidah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah.  and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah according to all that his fathers had done. in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him. and jehovah sent against him bands of the chaldeans and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of jehovah which he spake by his servants the prophets. surely at the commandment of jehovah came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood and jehovah would not pardon. now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.  and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of babylon had taken from the brook of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt. jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mothers name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah according to all that his father had done. at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up to jerusalem and the city was besieged. and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came unto the city while his servants were besieging it and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of jehovah as jehovah had said.  and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valor even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and the smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land. and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the kings mother and the kings wives and his officers and the chief men of the land carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon. and all the men of might even seven thousand and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand all of them strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon. and the king of babylon made mattaniah [jehoiachins] fathers brother king is his stead and changed his name to zedekiah. zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah according to all that jehoiakim had done.  for through the anger of jehovah did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence. and zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon. and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and encamped against it and they built forts against it round about. so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah. on the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land. then a breach was made in the city and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were against the city round about and [the king] went by the way of the arabah. but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him. then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him.  and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him in fetters and carried him to babylon. now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon unto jerusalem. and he burnt the house of jehovah and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burnt he with fire. and all the army of the chaldeans that were [with] the captain of the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about. and the residue of the people that were left in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the residue of the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive. but the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. and the pillars of brass that were in the house of jehovah and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of jehovah did the chaldeans break in pieces and carried the brass of them to babylon.  and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away. and the firepans and the basins that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away. the two pillars the one sea and the bases which solomon had made for the house of jehovah the brass of all these vessels was without weight. the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and a capital of brass was upon it and the height of the capital was three cubits with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with network. and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that saw the kings face who were found in the city and the scribe the captain of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city.  and nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah. and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath. so judah was carried away captive out of his land. and as for the people that were left in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan governor. now when all the captains of the forces they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men. and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto them fear not because of the servants of the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you.  but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten men with him and smote gedaliah so that he died and the jews and the chaldeans that were with him at mizpah. and all the people both small and great and the captains of the forces arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldeans. and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison and he spake kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon and changed his prison garments. and [jehoiachin] did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life and for his allowance there was a continual allowance given him of the king every day a portion all the days of his life. adam seth enosh

and hanan these were the sons of azel. now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa. and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul. and the battle went sore against saul and the archers overtook him and he was distressed by reason of the archers.  then said saul unto his armor bearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. but his armorbearer would not for he was sore afraid. therefore saul took his sword and fell upon it. and when his armorbearer saw that saul was dead he likewise fell upon his sword and died. so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together. and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them. and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa. and they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry the tidings unto their idols and to the people. and they put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the house of dagon. and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul  all the valiant men arose and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days. so saul died for his trespass which he committed against jehovah because of the word of jehovah which he kept not and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to inquire [thereby] and inquired not of jehovah therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse. then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh. in times past even when saul was king it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in israel and jehovah thy god said unto thee thou shalt be shepherd of my people israel and thou shalt be prince over my people israel. so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before jehovah and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of jehovah by samuel.  and david and all israel went to jerusalem the same is jebus and the jebusites the inhabitants of the land were there. and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come in hither. nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david. and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain. and joab the son of zeruiah went up first and was made chief. and david dwelt in the stronghold therefore they called it the city of david. and he built the city round about from millo even round about and joab repaired the rest of the city. and david waxed greater and greater for jehovah of hosts was with him. now these are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom together with all israel to make him king according to the word of jehovah concerning israel. and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam the son of a hachmonite the chief of the thirty he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.  and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighty men. he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a plot of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines. and they stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and slew the philistines and jehovah saved them by a great victory. and three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines were encamped in the valley of rephaim. and david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in beth lehem. and david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of beth lehem which is by the gate and the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of beth lehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink thereof but poured it out unto jehovah  and said my god forbid it me that i should do this shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. therefore he would not drink it. these things did the three mighty men. and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had a name among the three. of the three he was more honorable than the two and was made their captain howbeit he attained not to the [first] three. benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he slew the two [sons of] ariel of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear. these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had a name among the three mighty men. behold he was more honorable than the thirty but he attained not to the [first] three and david set him over his guard.  also the mighty men of the armies asahel the brother of joab elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem shammoth the harorite helez the pelonite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anathothite sibbecai the hushathite ilai the ahohite maharai the netophathite heled the son of baanah the netophathite ithai the son of ribai of gibeah of the children of benjamin benaiah the pirathonite hurai of the brooks of gaash abiel the arbathite azmaveth the baharumite eliahba the shaalbonite the sons of hashem the gizonite jonathan the son of shagee the hararite ahiam the son of sacar the hararite eliphal the son of ur hepher the mecherathite ahijah the pelonite hezro the carmelite naarai the son of ezbai joel the brother of nathan mibhar the son of hagri zelek the ammonite naharai the berothite the armorbearer of joab the son of zeruiah ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite uriah the hittite zabad the son of ahlai adina the son of shiza the reubenite a chief of the reubenites and thirty with him  hanan the son of maacah and joshaphat the mithnite uzzia the ashterathite shama and jeiel the sons of hotham the aroerite jediael the son of shimri and joha his brother the tizite eliel the mahavite and jeribai and joshaviah the sons of elnaam and ithmah the moabite eliel and obed and jaasiel the mezobaite. now these are they that came to david to ziklag while he yet kept himself close because of saul the son of kish and they were among the mighty men his helpers in war. they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow they were of sauls brethren of benjamin. the chief was ahiezer then joash the sons of shemaah the gibeathite and jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth and beracah and jehu the anathothite and ishmaiah the gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and over the thirty and jeremiah and jahaziel and johanan and jozabad the gederathite eluzai and jerimoth and bealiah and shemariah and shephatiah the haruphite  elkanah and isshiah and azarel and joezer and jashobeam the korahites and joelah and zebadiah the sons of jeroham of gedor. and of the gadites there separated themselves unto david to the stronghold in the wilderness mighty men of valor men trained for war that could handle shield and spear whose faces were like the faces of lions and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains ezer the chief obadiah the second eliab the third mishmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth attai the sixth eliel the seventh johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth jeremiah the tenth machbannai the eleventh. these of the sons of gad were captains of the host he that was least was equal to a hundred and the greatest to a thousand. these are they that went over the jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west. and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the stronghold unto david.  and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me my heart shall be knit unto you but if [ye be come] to betray me to mine adversaries seeing there is no wrong in my hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it. then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the thirty [and he said] thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thy helpers for thy god helpeth thee. then david received them and made them captains of the band. of manasseh also there fell away some to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he will fall away to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads.  as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zillethai captains of thousands that were of manasseh.  and they helped david against the band of rovers for they were all mighty men of valor and were captains in the host. for from day to day men came to david to help him until there was a great host like the host of god. and these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war who came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of jehovah. the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred armed for war. of the children of simeon mighty men of valor for the war seven thousand and one hundred. of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred. and jehoiada was the leader of [the house of] aaron and with him were three thousand and seven hundred and zadok a young man mighty of valor and of his fathers house twenty and two captains. and of the children of benjamin the brethren of saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of saul.  and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valor famous men in their fathers houses.  and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand who were mentioned by name to come and make david king. and of the children of issachar men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment. of zebulun such as were able to go out in the host that could set the battle in array with all manner of instruments of war fifty thousand and that could order [the battle array and were] not of double heart. and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. and of the danites that could set the battle in array twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. and of asher such as were able to go out in the host that could set the battle in array forty thousand. and on the other side of the jordan of the reubenites and the gadites and of the halftribe of manasseh with all manner of instruments of war for the battle a hundred and twenty thousand.  all these being men of war that could order the battle array came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king. and they were there with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had made preparation for them. moreover they that were nigh unto them [even] as far as issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen victuals of meal cakes of figs and clusters of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep in abundance for there was joy in israel. and david consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds even with every leader. and david said unto all the assembly of israel if it seem good unto you and if it be of jehovah our god let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of israel with whom the priests and levites are in their cities that have suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we sought not unto it in the days of saul.  and all the assembly said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. so david assembled all israel together from the shihor [the brook] of egypt even unto the entrance of hamath to bring the ark of god from kiriath jearim. and david went up and all israel to baalah [that is] to kiriath jearim which belonged to judah to bring up from thence the ark of god jehovah that sitteth [above] the cherubim that is called by the name. and they carried the ark of god upon a new cart [and brought it] out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drove the cart. and david and all israel played before god with all their might even with songs and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets. and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled. and the anger of jehovah was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put forth his hand to the ark and there he died before god.  and david was displeased because jehovah had broken forth upon uzza and he called that place perez uzza unto this day. and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me so david removed not the ark unto him into the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obed edom the gittite. and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and jehovah blessed the house of obededom and all that he had. and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and masons and carpenters to build him a house. and david perceived that jehovah had established him king over israel for his kingdom was exalted on high for his people israels sake. and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons and daughters. and these are the names of the children whom he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon and ibhar and elishua and elpelet and nogah and nepheg and japhia and elishama and beeliada and eliphelet.  and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them. now the philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of rephaim. and david inquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into my hand and jehovah said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thy hand. so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there and david said god hath broken mine enemies by my hand like the breach of waters. therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim. and they left their gods there and david gave commandment and they were burned with fire. and the philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. and david inquired again of god and god said unto him thou shalt not go up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberrytrees.  and it shall be when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberrytrees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone out before thee to smite the host of the philistines. and david did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gezer. and the fame of david went out into all lands and jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations. and [david] made him houses in the city of david and he prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent. then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath jehovah chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister unto him for ever. and david assembled all israel at jerusalem to bring up the ark of jehovah unto its place which he had prepared for it. and david gathered together the sons of aaron and the levites of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren a hundred and twenty of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren a hundred and thirty  of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren a hundred and twelve. and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab and said unto them ye are the heads of the fathers [houses] of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of jehovah the god of israel unto [the place] that i have prepared for it. for because ye [bare it] not at the first jehovah our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not according to the ordinance. so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of jehovah the god of israel. and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of jehovah.  and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the doorkeepers. so the singers heman asaph and ethan [were appointed] with cymbals of brass to sound aloud and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries set to alamoth and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps set to the sheminith to lead. and chenaniah chief of the levites was over the song he instructed about the song because he was skilful.  and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. and shebaniah and joshaphat and nethanel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow the trumpets before the ark of god and obed edom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of jehovah out of the house of obededom with joy. and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams. and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song [with] the singers and david had upon him an ephod of linen. thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of jehovah with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.  and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of jehovah came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart. and they brought in the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burntofferings and peace offerings before god. and when david had made an end of offering the burntoffering and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of jehovah. and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a portion [of flesh] and a cake of raisins. and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of jehovah and to celebrate and to thank and praise jehovah the god of israel asaph the chief and second to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps and asaph with cymbals sounding aloud  and benaiah and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god. then on that day did david first ordain to give thanks unto jehovah by the hand of asaph and his brethren. o give thanks unto jehovah call upon his name make known his doings among the peoples. sing unto him sing praises unto him talk ye of all his marvellous works. glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek jehovah. seek ye jehovah and his strength seek his face evermore. remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones. he is jehovah our god his judgments are in all the earth. remember his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations [the covenant] which he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a statute to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance  when ye were but a few men in number yea very few and sojourners in it and they went about from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people. he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes [saying] touch not mine anointed ones and do my prophets no harm. sing unto jehovah all the earth show forth his salvation from day to day. declare his glory among the nations his marvellous works among all the peoples. for great is jehovah and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods. for all the gods of the peoples are idols but jehovah made the heavens. honor and majesty are before him strength and gladness are in his place. ascribe unto jehovah ye kindreds of the peoples ascribe unto jehovah glory and strength ascribe unto jehovah the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship jehovah in holy array. tremble before him all the earth the world also is established that it cannot be moved.  let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let them say among the nations jehovah reigneth. let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the field exult and all that is therein then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before jehovah for he cometh to judge the earth. o give thanks unto jehovah for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the nations to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise. blessed be jehovah the god of israel from everlasting even to everlasting. and all the people said amen and praised jehovah. so he left there before the ark of the covenant of jehovah asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every days work required and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obed edom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be doorkeepers and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of jehovah in the high place that was at gibeon  to offer burnt offerings unto jehovah upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening even according to all that is written in the law of jehovah which he commanded unto israel and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were mentioned by name to give thanks to jehovah because his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and with them heman and jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud and [with] instruments for the songs of god and the sons of jeduthun to be at the gate. and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house. and it came to pass when david dwelt in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of jehovah [dwelleth] under curtains. and nathan said unto david do all that is in thy heart for god is with thee. and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying go and tell david my servant thus saith jehovah thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in  for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from [one] tabernacle [to another]. in all places wherein i have walked with all israel spake i a word with any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to be shepherd of my people saying why have ye not built me a house of cedar now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith jehovah of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep that thou shouldest be prince over my people israel and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and i will make thee a name like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. and i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the first and [as] from the day that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and i will subdue all thine enemies. moreover i tell thee that jehovah will build thee a house.  and it shall come to pass when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will set up thy seed after thee who shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom. he shall build me a house and i will establish his throne for ever. i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my lovingkindness away from him as i took it from him that was before thee but i will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for ever. according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david. then david the king went in and sat before jehovah and he said who am i o jehovah god and what is my house that thou hast brought me thus far and this was a small thing in thine eyes o god but thou hast spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o jehovah god. what can david [say] yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant for thou knowest thy servant.  o jehovah for thy servants sake and according to thine own heart hast thou wrought all this greatness to make known all [these] great things. o jehovah there is none like thee neither is there any god besides thee according to all that we have heard with our ears. and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem unto himself for a people to make thee a name by great and terrible things in driving out nations from before thy people whom thou redeemest out of egypt for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou jehovah becamest their god. and now o jehovah let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast spoken. and let thy name be established and magnified for ever saying jehovah of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and the house of david thy servant is established before thee. for thou o my god hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house therefore hath thy servant found [in his heart] to pray before thee.  and now o jehovah thou art god and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o jehovah hast blessed and it is blessed for ever. and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and its towns out of the hand of the philistines. and he smote moab and the moabites became servants to david and brought tribute. and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to establish his dominion by the river euphrates. and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david hocked all the chariot horses but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. and when the syrians of damascus came to succor hadarezer king of zobah david smote of the syrians two and twenty thousand men.  then david put [garrisons] in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought tribute. and jehovah gave victory to david whithersoever he went. and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem. and from tibhath and from cun cities of hadarezer david took very much brass wherewith solomon made the brazen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass.  and when tou king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah he sent hadoram his son to king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had wars with tou and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. these also did king david dedicate unto jehovah with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek. moreover abishai the son of zeruiah smote of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.  and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became servants to david. and jehovah gave victory to david whithersoever he went. and david reigned over all israel and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder  and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were priests and shavsha was scribe and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king. and it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead. and david said i will show kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father showed kindness to me. so david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him.  but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honor thy father in that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land so hanun took davids servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away. then there went certain persons and told david how the men were served. and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed. and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return.  and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of arammaacah and out of zobah. so they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maacah and his people who came and encamped before medeba. and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle. and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men.  and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians. and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and they put themselves in array against the children of ammon. and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee. be of good courage and let us play the man for our people and for the cities of our god and jehovah do that which seemeth him good. so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him. and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city. then joab came to jerusalem.  and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river with shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer at their head. and it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them. so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him. and the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host. and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and served him neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more. and it came to pass at the time of the return of the year at the time when kings go out [to battle] that joab led forth the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah. but david tarried at jerusalem. and joab smote rabbah and overthrew it.  and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much. and he brought forth the people that were therein and cut [them] with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes. and thus did david unto all the cities of the children of ammon. and david and all the people returned to jerusalem. and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines then sibbecai the hushathite slew sippai of the sons of the giant and they were subdued. and there was again war with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam. and there was again war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six [on each hand] and six [on each foot] and he also was born unto the giant. and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother slew him. these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants.  and satan stood up against israel and moved david to number israel. and david said to joab and to the princes of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring me word that i may know the sum of them. and joab said jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are but my lord the king are they not all my lords servants why doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of guilt unto israel nevertheless the kings word prevailed against joab. wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem. and joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto david. and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the kings word was abominable to joab. and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel. and david said unto god i have sinned greatly in that i have done this thing but now put away i beseech thee the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly.  and jehovah spake unto gad davids seer saying go and speak unto david saying thus saith jehovah i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee. so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith jehovah take which thou wilt either three years of famine or three months to be consumed before thy foes while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of jehovah even pestilence in the land and the angel of jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of israel. now therefore consider what answer i shall return to him that sent me. and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall i pray into the hand of jehovah for very great are his mercies and let me not fall into the hand of man. so jehovah sent a pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men. and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was about to destroy jehovah beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the destroying angel it is enough now stay thy hand. and the angel of jehovah was standing by the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite.  and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of jehovah standing between earth and heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem. then david and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces. and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done very wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thy hand i pray thee o jehovah my god be against me and against my fathers house but not against thy people that they should be plagued. then the angel of jehovah commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and rear an altar unto jehovah in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite. and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of jehovah. and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. now ornan was threshing wheat. and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshing floor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground.  then david said to ornan give me the place of this threshing floor that i may build thereon an altar unto jehovah for the full price shalt thou give it me that the plague may be stayed from the people. and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give [thee] the oxen for burntofferings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the mealoffering i give it all. and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for jehovah nor offer a burnt offering without cost. so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. and david built there an altar unto jehovah and offered burntofferings and peace offerings and called upon jehovah and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burntoffering. and jehovah commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. at that time when david saw that jehovah had answered him in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there.  for the tabernacle of jehovah which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of burntoffering were at that time in the high place at gibeon. but david could not go before it to inquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of jehovah. then david said this is the house of jehovah god and this is the altar of burnt offering for israel. and david commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god. and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings and brass in abundance without weight and cedartrees without number for the sidonians and they of tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to david. and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for jehovah must be exceeding magnificent of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore make preparation for it. so david prepared abundantly before his death.  then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build a house for jehovah the god of israel. and david said to solomon his son as for me it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of jehovah my god. but the word of jehovah came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build a house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever. now my son jehovah be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of jehovah thy god as he hath spoken concerning thee. only jehovah give thee discretion and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that so thou mayest keep the law of jehovah thy god.  then shalt thou prosper if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which jehovah charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage fear not neither be dismayed. now behold in my affliction i have prepared for the house of jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto. moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all men that are skilful in every manner of work of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number. arise and be doing and jehovah be with thee. david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son [saying] is not jehovah your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand and the land is subdued before jehovah and before his people.  now set your heart and your soul to seek after jehovah your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of jehovah god to bring the ark of the covenant of jehovah and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of jehovah. now david was old and full of days and he made solomon his son king over israel. and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites. and the levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand. of these twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of jehovah and six thousand were officers and judges and four thousand were doorkeepers and four thousand praised jehovah with the instruments which i made [said david] to praise therewith. and david divided them into courses according to the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari. of the gershonites ladan and shimei. the sons of ladan jehiel the chief and zetham and joel three.  the sons of shimei shelomoth and haziel and haran three. these were the heads of the fathers [houses] of ladan. and the sons of shimei jahath zina and jeush and beriah. these four were the sons of shimei. and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they became a fathers house in one reckoning. the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four. the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for ever to burn incense before jehovah to minister unto him and to bless in his name for ever. but as for moses the man of god his sons were named among the tribe of levi. the sons of moses gershom and eliezer. the sons of gershom shebuel the chief. and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezer had no other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many. the sons of izhar shelomith the chief. the sons of hebron jeriah the chief amariah the second jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth.  the sons of uzziel micah the chief and isshiah the second. the sons of merari mahli and mushi. the sons of mahli eleazar and kish. and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters only and their brethren the sons of kish took them [to wife]. the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three. these were the sons of levi after their fathers houses even the heads of the fathers [houses] of those of them that were counted in the number of names by their polls who did the work for the service of the house of jehovah from twenty years old and upward. for david said jehovah the god of israel hath given rest unto his people and he dwelleth in jerusalem for ever and also the levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof. for by the last words of david the sons of levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward. for their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of jehovah in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things even the work of the service of the house of god  for the showbread also and for the fine flour for a meal offering whether of unleavened wafers or of that which is baked in the pan or of that which is soaked and for all manner of measure and size and to stand every morning to thank and praise jehovah and likewise at even and to offer all burntofferings unto jehovah on the sabbaths on the new moons and on the set feasts in number according to the ordinance concerning them continually before jehovah and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren for the service of the house of jehovah. and the courses of the sons of aaron [were these]. the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar. but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office. and david with zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar divided them according to their ordering in their service.  and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and [thus] were they divided of the sons of eleazar there were sixteen heads of fathers houses and of the sons of ithamar according to their fathers houses eight. thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of god both of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar. and shemaiah the son of nethanel the scribe who was of the levites wrote them in the presence of the king and the princes and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and the heads of the fathers [houses] of the priests and of the levites one fathers house being taken for eleazar and one taken for ithamar. now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib the second to jedaiah the third to harim the fourth to seorim the fifth to malchijah the sixth to mijamin the seventh to hakkoz the eighth to abijah the ninth to jeshua the tenth to shecaniah the eleventh to eliashib the twelfth to jakim the thirteenth to huppah the fourteenth to jeshebeab  the fifteenth to bilgah the sixteenth to immer the seventeenth to hezir the eighteenth to

the son of pedaiah of the half [tribe] of manasseh in gilead iddo the son of zechariah of benjamin jaasiel the son of abner of dan azarel the son of jeroham. these were the captains of the tribes of israel. but david took not the number of them from twenty years old and under because jehovah had said he would increase israel like to the stars of heaven.  joab the son of zeruiah began to number but finished not and there came wrath for this upon israel neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king david. and over the kings treasures was azmaveth the son of adiel and

and possessions of the king and of his sons with the officers and the mighty men even all the mighty men of valor unto jerusalem. then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of jehovah and for the footstool of our god and i had made ready for the building. but god said unto me thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou art a man of war and hast shed blood.  howbeit jehovah the god of israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be prince and in the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all israel and of all my sons for jehovah hath given me many sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of jehovah over israel. and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father. and i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances as at this day. now therefore in the sight of all israel the assembly of jehovah and in the audience of our god observe and seek out all the commandments of jehovah your god that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever.  and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for jehovah searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever. take heed now for jehovah hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it. then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of the temple] and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper rooms thereof and of the inner chambers thereof and of the place of the mercyseat and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit for the courts of the house of jehovah and for all the chambers round about for the treasuries of the house of god and for the treasuries of the dedicated things also for the courses of the priests and the levites and for all the work of the service of the house of jehovah and for all the vessels of service in the house of jehovah  of gold by weight for the [vessels of] gold for all vessels of every kind of service [of silver] for all the vessels of silver by weight for all vessels of every kind of service by weight also for the candlesticks of gold and for the lamps thereof of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof and for the candlesticks of silver [silver] by weight for [every] candlestick and for the lamps thereof according to the use of every candlestick and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread for every table and silver for the tables of silver and the flesh hooks and the basins and the cups of pure gold and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the chariot [even] the cherubim that spread out [their wings] and covered the ark of the covenant of jehovah. all this [said david] have i been made to understand in writing from the hand of jehovah even all the works of this pattern.  and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for jehovah god even my god is with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until all the work for the service of the house of jehovah be finished. and behold there are the courses of the priests and the levites for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill for any manner of service also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment. and david the king said unto all the assembly solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for jehovah god. now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for the [things of] gold and the silver for the [things of] silver and the brass for the [things of] brass the iron for the [things of] iron and wood for the [things of] wood onyx stones and [stones] to be set stones for inlaid work and of divers colors and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance.  moreover also because i have set my affection on the house of my god seeing that i have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver i give it unto the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses of gold for the [things of] gold and of silver for the [things of] silver and for all manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto jehovah then the princes of the fathers [houses] and the princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers over the kings work offered willingly and they gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and of iron a hundred thousand talents. and they with whom [precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of jehovah under the hand of jehiel the gershonite.  then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to jehovah and david the king also rejoiced with great joy. wherefore david blessed jehovah before all the assembly and david said blessed be thou o jehovah the god of israel our father for ever and ever. thine o jehovah is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heavens and in the earth [is thine] thine is the kingdom o jehovah and thou art exalted as head above all. both riches and honor come of thee and thou rulest over all and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all. now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee. for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as all our fathers were our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is no abiding.  o jehovah our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand and is all thine own. i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness. as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people that are present here offer willingly unto thee. o jehovah the god of abraham of isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for which i have made provision. and david said to all the assembly now bless jehovah your god. and all the assembly blessed jehovah the god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped jehovah and the king.  and they sacrificed sacrifices unto jehovah and offered burnt offerings unto jehovah on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drinkofferings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel and did eat and drink before jehovah on that day with great gladness. and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto jehovah to be prince and zadok to be priest. then solomon sat on the throne of jehovah as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him. and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king. and jehovah magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel. now david the son of jesse reigned over all israel. and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three [years] reigned he in jerusalem.  and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honor and solomon his son reigned in his stead. now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the history of samuel the seer and in the history of nathan the prophet and in the history of gad the seer with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries.  and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and jehovah his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly. and solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every prince in all israel the heads of the fathers [houses]. so solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tent of meeting of god which moses the servant of jehovah had made in the wilderness. but the ark of god had david brought up from kiriathjearim to [the place] that david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem.  moreover the brazen altar that bezalel the son of uri the son of hur had made was there before the tabernacle of jehovah and solomon and the assembly sought unto it. and solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before jehovah which was at the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee. and solomon said unto god thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto david my father and hast made me king in his stead.  now o jehovah god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great and god said to solomon because this was in thy heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honor nor the life of them that hate thee neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom i have made thee king  wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like. so solomon came from the high place that was at gibeon from before the tent of meeting unto jerusalem and he reigned over israel. and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem.  and the king made silver and gold to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance. and the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt the kings merchants received them in droves each drove at a price. and they fetched up and brought out of egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means. now solomon purposed to build a house for the name of jehovah and a house for his kingdom.  and solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein [even so deal with me]. behold i am about to build a house for the name of jehovah my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him incense of sweet spices and for the continual showbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts of jehovah our god. this is [an ordinance] for ever to israel. and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods. but who is able to build him a house seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should build him a house save only to burn incense before him  now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that knoweth how to grave [all manner of] gravings [to be] with the skilful men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide. send me also cedartrees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that thy servants know how to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be great and wonderful. and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil. then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because jehovah loveth his people he hath made thee king over them.  huram said moreover blessed be jehovah the god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with discretion and understanding that should build a house for jehovah and a house for his kingdom. and now i have sent a skilful man endued with understanding of huram my fathers the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to devise any device that there may be [a place] appointed unto him with thy skilful men and with the skilful men of my lord david thy father. now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem.  and solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred. and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work. then solomon began to build the house of jehovah at jerusalem on mount moriah where [jehovah] appeared unto david his father which he made ready in the place that david had appointed in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite. and he began to build in the second [day] of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. now these are the foundations which solomon laid for the building of the house of god. the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits.  and the porch that was before [the house] the length of it according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and the height a hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold. and the greater house he ceiled with firwood which he overlaid with fine gold and wrought thereon palm trees and chains. and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim. he overlaid also the house the beams the thresholds and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubim on the walls. and he made the most holy house the length thereof according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents. and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. and in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work and they overlaid them with gold.  and the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long the wing of the one [cherub] was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was [likewise] five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub. and the wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits [also] joining to the wing of the other cherub. the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were toward the house. and he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubim thereon. also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. and he made chains in the oracle and put [them] on the tops of the pillars and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. and he set up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz.  moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof. also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and the height thereof was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about. and under it was the likeness of oxen which did compass it round about for ten cubits compassing the sea round about. the oxen were in two rows cast when it was cast. it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set upon them above and all their hinder parts were inward. and it was a handbreadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it received and held three thousand baths. he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as belonged to the burntoffering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in.  and he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them and he set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left. he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left. and he made a hundred basins of gold. furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass. and he set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward toward the south. and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basins. so huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king solomon in the house of god the two pillars and the bowls and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars. he made also the bases and the lavers made he upon the bases one sea and the twelve oxen under it.  the pots also and the shovels and the flesh hooks and all the vessels thereof did huram his father make for king solomon for the house of jehovah of bright brass. in the plain of the jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredah. thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out. and solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon was the showbread and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle of pure gold and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and that perfect gold and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the firepans of pure gold and as for the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house [to wit] of the temple were of gold. thus all the work that solomon wrought for the house of jehovah was finished. and solomon brought in the things that david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of god.  then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers [houses] of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of jehovah out of the city of david which is zion. nd all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast which was [in] the seventh month. and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent these did the priests the levites bring up. and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of jehovah unto its place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim. for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. and the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day.  there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put [there] at horeb when jehovah made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt. and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves and did not keep their courses also the levites who were the singers all of them even asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and their brethren arrayed in fine linen with cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking jehovah and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised jehovah [saying] for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of jehovah so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of jehovah filled the house of god.  then spake solomon jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. but i have built thee a house of habitation and a place for thee to dwell in for ever. and the king turned his face and blessed all the assembly of israel and all the assembly of israel stood. and he said blessed be jehovah the god of israel who spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hands fulfilled it saying since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be prince over my people israel but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel. now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of jehovah the god of israel. but jehovah said unto david my father whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name thou didst well that it was in thy heart nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name.  and jehovah hath performed his word that he spake for i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as jehovah promised and have built the house for the name of jehovah the god of israel. and there have i set the ark wherein is the covenant of jehovah which he made with the children of israel. and he stood before the altar of jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands for solomon had made a brazen scaffold five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and he said o jehovah the god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven or on earth who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart who hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou didst promise him yea thou spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand as it is this day.  now therefore o jehovah the god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me. now therefore o jehovah the god of israel let thy word be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david. but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have builded yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o jehovah my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. and hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place yea hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive.  if a man sin against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and he come [and] swear before thine altar in this house then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants requiting the wicked to bring his way upon his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness. and if thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.  if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow and shall spread forth his hands toward this house then hear thou from heaven thy dwellingplace and forgive and render unto every man according to all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. moreover concerning the foreigner that is not of thy people israel when he shall come from a far country for thy great names sake and thy mighty hand and thine outstretched arm when they shall come and pray toward this house  then hear thou from heaven even from thy dwellingplace and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have built is called by thy name. if thy people go out to battle against their enemies by whatsoever way thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause. if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn again and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done perversely and have dealt wickedly  if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captive and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name then hear thou from heaven even from thy dwellingplace their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee. now o my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. now therefore arise o jehovah god into thy restingplace thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o jehovah god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. o jehovah god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember [thy] lovingkindnesses to david thy servant. now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burntoffering and the sacrifices and the glory of jehovah filled the house.  and the priests could not enter into the house of jehovah because the glory of jehovah filled jehovahs house.  and all the children of israel looked on when the fire came down and the glory of jehovah was upon the house and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and gave thanks unto jehovah [saying] for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before jehovah. and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god. and the priests stood according to their offices the levites also with instruments of music of jehovah which david the king had made to give thanks unto jehovah for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever when david praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood.  moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of jehovah for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brazen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering and the mealoffering and the fat.  so solomon held the feast at that time seven days and all israel with him a very great assembly from the entrance of hamath unto the brook of egypt. and on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that jehovah had showed unto david and to solomon and to israel his people. thus solomon finished the house of jehovah and the kings house and all that came into solomons heart to make in the house of jehovah and in his own house he prosperously effected. and jehovah appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.  if i shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or if i command the locust to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land. now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. for now have i chosen and hallowed this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom according as i covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel. but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them  then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and i will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. and this house which is so high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall say why hath jehovah done thus unto this land and to this house and they shall answer because they forsook jehovah the god of their fathers who brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them. and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of jehovah and his own house that the cities which huram had given to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there. and solomon went to hamath zobah and prevailed against it. and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in hamath. also he built bethhoron the upper and beth horon the nether fortified cities with walls gates and bars  and baalath and all the storecities that solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and all that solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion. as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites that were not of israel of their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not of them did solomon raise a levy [of bondservants] unto this day. but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. and these were the chief officers of king solomon even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people. and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of jehovah hath come.  then solomon offered burnt offerings unto jehovah on the altar of jehovah which he had built before the porch even as the duty of every day required offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts three times in the year [even] in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles. and he appointed according to the ordinance of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their offices to praise and to minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded. and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures. now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of jehovah and until it was finished. [so] the house of jehovah was completed. then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth on the seashore in the land of edom.  and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they came with the servants of solomon to ophir and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon. and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great train and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart. and solomon told her all her questions and there was not anything hid from solomon which he told her not. and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of jehovah there was no more spirit in her. and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom.  howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me thou exceedest the fame that i heard. happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants that stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom. blessed be jehovah thy god who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for jehovah thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do justice and righteousness. and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and spices in great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave to king solomon. and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon that brought gold from ophir brought algumtrees and precious stones. and the king made of the algumtrees terraces for the house of jehovah and for the kings house and harps and psalteries for the singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah.  and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked besides that which she had brought unto the king. so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants. now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold besides that which the traders and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon. and king solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one buckler. and [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon. moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. nd there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the stays.  and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom. and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold silver was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon. for the king had ships that went to tarshish with the servants of huram once every three years came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks. so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart. and they brought every man his tribute vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment armor and spices horses and mules a rate year by year. and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem. and he ruled over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt.  and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance. and they brought horses for solomon out of egypt and out of all lands. now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the history of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer concerning jeroboam the son of nebat and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years. and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king. and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of it for he was in egypt whither he had fled from the presence of king solomon that jeroboam returned out of egypt. and they sent and called him and jeroboam and all israel came and they spake to rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee. and he said unto them come again unto me after three days. and the people departed. and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people and they spake unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever. but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him that stood before him. and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter  and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger is thicker than my fathers loins. and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i [will chastise you] with scorpions. so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king bade saying come to me again the third day. and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i [will chastise you] with scorpions. so the king hearkened not unto the people for it was brought about of god that jehovah might establish his word which he spake by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat.  and when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david. so all israel departed unto their tents. but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them. then king rehoboam sent hadoram who was over the men subject to taskwork and the children of israel stoned him to death with stones. and king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem. so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day. and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled the house of judah and benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors to fight against israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam. but the word of jehovah came to shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying  thus saith jehovah ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is of me. so they hearkened unto the words of jehovah and returned from going against jeroboam. and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah. he built beth lehem and etam and tekoa and bethzur and soco and adullam and gath and mareshah and ziph and adoraim and lachish and azekah and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fortified cities. and he fortified the strongholds and put captains in them and stores of victuals and oil and wine. and in every city [he put] shields and spears and made them exceeding strong. and judah and benjamin belonged to him. and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their border. for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons cast them off that they should not execute the priests office unto jehovah and he appointed him priests for the high places and for the he goats and for the calves which he had made.  and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek jehovah the god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto jehovah the god of their fathers. so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for they walked three years in the way of david and solomon. and rehoboam took him a wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david [and of] abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse and she bare him sons jeush and shemariah and zaham. and after her he took maacah the daughter of absalom and she bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith. and rehoboam loved maacah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters. and rehoboam appointed abijah the son of maacah to be chief [even] the prince among his brethren for [he was minded] to make him king.  and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of judah and benjamin unto every fortified city and he gave them victuals in abundance. and he sought [for them] many wives. and it came to pass when the kingdom of rehoboam was established and he was strong that he forsook the law of jehovah and all israel with him. and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had trespassed against jehovah with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen. and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubim the sukkiim and the ethiopians. and he took the fortified cities which pertained to judah and came unto jerusalem. now shemaiah the prophet came to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith jehovah ye have forsaken me therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak.  then the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said jehovah is righteous. and when jehovah saw that they humbled themselves the word of jehovah came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak. nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house he took all away he took away also the shields of gold which solomon had made. and king rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard that kept the door of the kings house. and it was so that as oft as the king entered into the house of jehovah the guard came and bare them and brought them back into the guardchamber.  and when he humbled himself the wrath of jehovah turned from him so as not to destroy him altogether and moreover in judah there were good things [found]. so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess. and he did that which was evil because he set not his heart to seek jehovah.  now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the histories of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer after the manner of genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually. and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead. in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah.  three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was micaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah. and there was war between abijah and jeroboam. and abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men and jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men who were mighty men of valor. and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in the hill country of ephraim and said hear me o jeroboam and all israel ought ye not to know that jehovah the god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david rose up and rebelled against his lord.  and there were gathered unto him worthless men base fellows that strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.  and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of jehovah in the hand of the sons of david and ye are a great multitude and there are with you the golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods. have ye not driven out the priests of jehovah the sons of aaron and the levites and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of [them that are] no gods. but as for us jehovah is our god and we have not forsaken him and [we have] priests ministering unto jehovah the sons of aaron and the levites in their work and they burn unto jehovah every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense the showbread also [set they] in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of jehovah our god but ye have forsaken him.  and behold god is with us at our head and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. o children of israel fight ye not against jehovah the god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper.  but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them. and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind them and they cried unto jehovah and the priests sounded with the trumpets. then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah. and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand. and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men. thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon jehovah the god of their fathers. and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephron with the towns thereof. neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and jehovah smote him and he died.  but abijah waxed mighty and took unto himself fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters. and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet iddo. so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead. in his days the land was quiet ten years. and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of jehovah his god for he took away the foreign altars and the high places and brake down the pillars and hewed down the asherim and commanded judah to seek jehovah the god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment. also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the sunimages and the kingdom was quiet before him. and he built fortified cities in judah for the land was quiet and he had no war in those years because jehovah had given him rest.  for he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars the land is yet before us because we have sought jehovah our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side. so they built and prospered. and asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valor. and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and he came unto mareshah. then asa went out to meet him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah. and asa cried unto jehovah his god and said jehovah there is none besides thee to help between the mighty and him that hath no strength help us o jehovah our god for we rely on thee and in thy name are we come against this multitude. o jehovah thou art our god let not man prevail against thee. so jehovah smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled.  and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and there fell of the ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before jehovah and before his host and they carried away very much booty. and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of jehovah came upon them and they despoiled all the cities for there was much spoil in them. they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep in abundance and camels and returned to jerusalem. and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin jehovah is with you while ye are with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you. now for a long season israel was without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law but when in their distress they turned unto jehovah the god of israel and sought him he was found of them.  and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. and they were broken in pieces nation against nation and city against city for god did vex them with all adversity. but be ye strong and let not your hands be slack for your work shall be rewarded. and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominations out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from the hillcountry of ephraim and he renewed the altar of jehovah that was before the porch of jehovah. and he gathered all judah and benjamin and them that sojourned with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that jehovah his god was with him. so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa. and they sacrificed unto jehovah in that day of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.  and they entered into the covenant to seek jehovah the god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul and that whosoever would not seek jehovah the god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman. and they sware unto jehovah with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets. and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and jehovah gave them rest round about. and also maacah the mother of asa the king he removed from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and made dust of it and burnt it at the brook kidron. but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days. and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels. and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa.  in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to asa king of judah. then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of jehovah and of the kings house and sent to ben hadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying [there is] a league between me and thee as [there was] between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me. and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abel maim and all the storecities of naphtali. and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building ramah and let his work cease. then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and he built therewith geba and mizpah.  and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and hast not relied on jehovah thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thy hand. were not the ethiopians and the lubim a huge host with chariots and horsemen exceeding many yet because thou didst rely on jehovah he delivered them into thy hand. for the eyes of jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. herein thou hast done foolishly for from henceforth thou shalt have wars. then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in the prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. and asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel. and in the thirty and ninth year of his reign asa was diseased in his feet his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to jehovah but to the physicians. and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.  and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had hewn out for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers art and they made a very great burning for him. and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel. and he placed forces in all the fortified cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken. and jehovah was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto the baalim but sought to the god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel. therefore jehovah established the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat tribute and he had riches and honor in abundance. and his heart was lifted up in the ways of jehovah and furthermore he took away the high places and the asherim out of judah.  also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes even benhail and obadiah and zechariah and nethanel and micaiah to teach in the cities of judah and with them the levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah the levites and with them elishama and jehoram the priests. and they taught in judah having the book of the law of jehovah with them and they went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught among the people. and the fear of jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat. and some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute the arabians also brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred hegoats. and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store. and he had many works in the cities of judah and men of war mighty men of valor in jerusalem.  and this was the numbering of them according to their fathers houses of judah the captains of thousands adnah the captain and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand and next to him jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand and next to him amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto jehovah and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valor and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield and next to him jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war. these were they that waited on the king besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all judah. now jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and he joined affinity with ahab. and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria. and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that were with him and moved him to go up [with him] to ramothgilead.  and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramoth gilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and [we will be] with thee in the war. and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire first i pray thee for the word of jehovah. then the king of israel gathered the prophets together four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the hand of the king. but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of jehovah besides that we may inquire of him and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of jehovah but i hate him for he never prophesieth good concerning me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla. and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so. then the king of israel called an officer and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla.  now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne arrayed in their robes and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them. and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus saith jehovah with these shalt thou push the syrians until they be consumed. and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good. and micaiah said as jehovah liveth what my god saith that will i speak. and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand. and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of jehovah  and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and jehovah said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace. and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil and [micaiah] said therefore hear ye the word of jehovah i saw jehovah sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. and jehovah said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner. and there came forth a spirit and stood before jehovah and said i will entice him. and jehovah said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. and he said thou shalt entice him and shalt prevail also go forth and do so. now therefore behold jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.  then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of jehovah from me to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. and the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace. and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace jehovah hath not spoken by me. and he said hear ye peoples all of you. so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead. and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but put thou on thy robes. so the king of israel disguised himself and they went into the battle. now the king of syria had commanded the captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel.  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel. therefore they turned about to fight against him but jehoshaphat cried out and jehovah helped him and god moved them [to depart] from him. and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him. and a certain man drew his bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the armor wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot turn thy hand and carry me out of the host for i am sore wounded. and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the going down of the sun he died. and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem. and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the wicked and love them that hate jehovah for this thing wrath is upon thee from before jehovah.  nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast put away the asheroth out of the land and hast set thy heart to seek god. and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beersheba to the hillcountry of ephraim and brought them back unto jehovah the god of their fathers. and he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of judah city by city and said to the judges consider what ye do for ye judge not for man but for jehovah and [he is] with you in the judgment. now therefore let the fear of jehovah be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with jehovah our god nor respect of persons nor taking of bribes. moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and the priests and of the heads of the fathers [houses] of israel for the judgment of jehovah and for controversies. and they returned to jerusalem. and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of jehovah faithfully and with a perfect heart.  and whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and ordinances ye shall warn them that they be not guilty towards jehovah and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not be guilty.  and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of jehovah and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah in all the kings matters also the levites shall be officers before you. deal courageously and jehovah be with the good. and it came to pass after this that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them some of the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle. then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from syria and behold they are in hazazontamar the same is en gedi. and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek unto jehovah and he proclaimed a fast throughout all judah.  and judah gathered themselves together to seek [help] of jehovah even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek jehovah. and jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of judah and jerusalem in the house of jehovah before the new court and he said o jehovah the god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations and in thy hand is power and might so that none is able to withstand thee.  didst not thou o our god drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and give it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if evil come upon us the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we will stand before this house and before thee for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction and thou wilt hear and save. and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned aside from them and destroyed them not  behold how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit. o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but out eyes are upon thee. and all judah stood before jehovah with their little ones their wives and their children.  then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah the levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of jehovah in the midst of the assembly and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith jehovah unto you fear not ye neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods. tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the ascent of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of jeruel.  ye shall not need to fight in this [battle] set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of jehovah with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for jehovah is with you. and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down before jehovah worshipping jehovah. and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korahites stood up to praise jehovah the god of israel with an exceeding loud voice. and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in jehovah your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper. and when he had taken counsel with the people he appointed them that should sing unto jehovah and give praise in holy array as they went out before the army and say give thanks unto jehovah for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever.  and when they began to sing and to praise jehovah set liers inwait against the children of ammon moab and mount seir that were come against judah and they were smitten. for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another. and when judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness they looked upon the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and there were none that escaped. and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in taking the spoil it was so much. and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of beracah for there they blessed jehovah therefore the name of that place was called the valley of beracah unto this day.  then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies. and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of jehovah. and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that jehovah fought against the enemies of israel. so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about. and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi. and he walked in the way of asa his father and turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of jehovah. howbeit the high places were not taken away neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the god of their fathers. now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the history of jehu the son of hanani which is inserted in the book of the kings of israel.  and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel the same did very wickedly and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongeber. then eliezer the son of dodavahu of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah jehovah hath destroyed thy works. and the ships were broken so that they were not able to go to tarshish. and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead. and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel. and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fortified cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn.  now when jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father and had strengthened himself he slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel. jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem. and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah. howbeit jehovah would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway. in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves. then jehoram passed over with his captains and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites that compassed him about and the captains of the chariots. so edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then did libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken jehovah the god of his fathers.  moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and made the inhabitants of jerusalem to play the harlot and led judah astray. and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith jehovah the god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to play the harlot like as the house of ahab did and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house who were better than thyself behold jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy substance and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. and jehovah stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that are beside the ethiopians  and they came up against judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons. and after all this jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. and it came to pass in process of time at the end of two years that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness and he died of sore diseases. and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers. thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and he departed without being desired and they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings. and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned. forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri.  he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah as did the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram. and he returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria. and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick. now the destruction of ahaziah was of god in that he went unto joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of ahab. and it came to pass when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab that he found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah ministering to ahaziah and slew them.  and he sought ahaziah and they caught him now he was hiding in samaria and they brought him to jehu and slew him and they buried him for they said he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought jehovah with all his heart. and the house of ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom. now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah. but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not. and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land.  and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him. and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the heads of fathers [houses] of israel and they came to jerusalem. and all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of god. and he said unto them behold the kings son shall reign as jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of david. this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that come in on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the thresholds and a third part shall be at the kings house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of jehovah. but let none come into the house of jehovah save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall come in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the charge of jehovah.  and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever cometh into the house let him be slain and be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out. so the levites and all judah did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. and jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears and bucklers and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of god. and he set all the people every man with his weapon in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house by the king round about. then they brought out the kings son and put the crown upon him and [gave him] the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and they said [long] live the king. and when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of jehovah  and she looked and behold the king stood by his pillar at the entrance and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets the singers also [played] on instruments of music and led the singing of praise. then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason and jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth between the ranks and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of jehovah. so they made way for her and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the kings house and they slew her there. and jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be jehovahs people. and all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars.  and jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of jehovah under the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of jehovah to offer the burnt offerings of jehovah as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing according to the order of david. and he set the porters at the gates of the house of jehovah that none that was unclean in anything should enter in. and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of jehovah and they came through the upper gate unto the kings house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. and athaliah they had slain with the sword. joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba. and joash did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah all the days of jehoiada the priest. and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters.  and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to restore the house of jehovah. and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter. howbeit the levites hastened it not. and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the tax of moses the servant of jehovah and of the assembly of israel for the tent of the testimony for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of jehovah did they bestow upon the baalim. so the king commanded and they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of jehovah. and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in for jehovah the tax that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness. and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end.  and it was so that at what time the chest was brought unto the kings officers by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the kings scribe and the chief priests officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to its place again. thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance. and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of jehovah and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of jehovah and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of jehovah. so the workmen wrought and the work of repairing went forward in their hands and they set up the house of god in its state and strengthened it. and when they had made an end they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of jehovah even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer and spoons and vessels of gold and silver. and they offered burntofferings in the house of jehovah continually all the days of jehoiada.  but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days and he died a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel and toward god and his house. now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king. then the king hearkened unto them. and they forsook the house of jehovah the god of their fathers and served the asherim and the idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their guiltiness. yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto jehovah and they testified against them but they would not give ear. and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest and he stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of jehovah so that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken jehovah he hath also forsaken you. and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of jehovah.  thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son. and when he died he said jehovah look upon it and require it. and it came to pass at the end of the year that the army of the syrians came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus. for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken jehovah the god of their fathers. so they executed judgment upon joash. and when they were departed for him for they left him very sick his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.  and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath the ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith the moabitess.  now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens [laid] upon him and the rebuilding of the house of god behold they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. and amaziah his son reigned in his stead. amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah but not with a perfect heart. now it came to pass when the kingdom was established unto him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. but he put not their children to death but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of moses as jehovah commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin.  moreover amaziah gathered judah together and ordered them according to their fathers houses under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds even all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward and found them three hundred thousand chosen men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield.  he hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of israel for a hundred talents of silver. but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for jehovah is not with israel [to wit] with all the children of ephraim. but if thou wilt go do [valiantly] be strong for the battle god will cast thee down before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down. and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered jehovah is able to give thee much more than this. then amaziah separated them [to wit] the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in fierce anger.  and amaziah took courage and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand.  and [other] ten thousand did the children of judah carry away alive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock so that they all were broken in pieces. but the men of the army whom amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto beth horon and smote of them three thousand and took much spoil. now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them. wherefore the anger of jehovah was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet who said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand  and it came to pass as he talked with him that [the king] said unto him have we made thee of the kings counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face. and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trod down the thistle. thou sayest lo thou hast smitten edom and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to [thy] hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee but amaziah would not hear for it was of god that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies] because they had sought after the gods of edom.  so joash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at beth shemesh which belongeth to judah. and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent. and joash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits. and [he took] all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria. and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years. now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel now from the time that amaziah did turn away from following jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there.  and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah. and all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah. he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers. sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jechiliah of jerusalem. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah according to all that his father amaziah had done. and he set himself to seek god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the vision of god and as long as he sought jehovah god made him to prosper. and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and he built cities in [the country of] ashdod and among the philistines. and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the meunim.  and the ammonites gave tribute to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of egypt for he waxed exceeding strong. moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning [of the wall] and fortified them. and he built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns for he had much cattle in the lowland also and in the plain [and he had] husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields for he loved husbandry. moreover uzziah had an army of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their reckoning made by jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the officer under the hand of hananiah one of the kings captains. the whole number of the heads of fathers [houses] even the mighty men of valor was two thousand and six hundred. and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy.  and uzziah prepared for them even for all the host shields and spears and helmets and coats of mail and bows and stones for slinging. and he made in jerusalem engines invented by skilful men to be on the towers and upon the battlements wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong. but when he was strong his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against jehovah his god for he went into the temple of jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense. and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of jehovah that were valiant men and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it pertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto jehovah but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honor from jehovah god.  then uzziah was wroth and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of jehovah beside the altar of incense. and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out quickly from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because jehovah had smitten him. and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a separate house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of jehovah and jotham his son was over the kings house judging the people of the land. now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write. so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead.  jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerushah the daughter of zadok. and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah according to all that his father uzziah had done howbeit he entered not into the temple of jehovah. and the people did yet corruptly. he built the upper gate of the house of jehovah and on the wall of ophel he built much. moreover he built cities in the hill country of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers. he fought also with the king of the children of ammon and prevailed against them. and the children of ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley. so much did the children of ammon render unto him in the second year also and in the third. so jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before jehovah his god. now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah.  he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem. and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead. ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he did not that which was right in the eyes of jehovah like david his father but he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for the baalim. moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire according to the abominations of the nations whom jehovah cast out before the children of israel. and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree. wherefore jehovah his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away of his a great multitude of captives and brought them to damascus. and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter.  for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day all of them valiant men because they had forsaken jehovah the god of their fathers. and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kings son and azrikam the ruler of the house and elkanah that was next to the king. and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria. but a prophet of jehovah was there whose name was oded and he went out to meet the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because jehovah the god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven. and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you [but] are there not even with you trespasses of your own against jehovah your god  now hear me therefore and send back the captives that ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of jehovah is upon you. then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against jehovah to add unto our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel. so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly. and the men that have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palmtrees unto their brethren then they returned to samaria.  at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him. for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives. the philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of judah and had taken beth shemesh and aijalon and gederoth and soco with the towns thereof and timnah with the towns thereof gimzo also and the towns thereof and they dwelt there. for jehovah brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he had dealt wantonly in judah and trespassed sore against jehovah. and tilgath pilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not. for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of jehovah and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of assyria but it helped him not. and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against jehovah this same king ahaz.  for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria helped them [therefore] will i sacrifice to them that they may help me. but they were the ruin of him and of all israel. and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of jehovah and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem. and in every city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger jehovah the god of his fathers. now the rest of his acts and all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel. and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah.  and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah according to all that david his father had done. he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of jehovah and repaired them. and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the broad place on the east and said unto them hear me ye levites now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of jehovah the god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the sight of jehovah our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of jehovah and turned their backs. also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel. wherefore the wrath of jehovah was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro to be an astonishment and a hissing as ye see with your eyes.  for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. now it is in my heart to make a covenant with jehovah the god of israel that his fierce anger may turn away from us. my sons be not now negligent for jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him to minister unto him and that ye should be his ministers and burn incense. then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehallelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeuel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah and of the sons of heman jehuel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel. and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and went in according to the commandment of the king by the words of jehovah to cleanse the house of jehovah.  and the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of jehovah to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of jehovah into the court of the house of jehovah. and the levites took it to carry it out abroad to the brook kidron. now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of jehovah and they sanctified the house of jehovah in eight days and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. then they went in to hezekiah the king within [the palace] and said we have cleansed all the house of jehovah and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the table of showbread with all the vessels thereof. moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of jehovah. then hezekiah the king arose early and gathered the princes of the city and went up to the house of jehovah.  and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah. and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of jehovah. so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar and they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and sprinkled the blood upon the altar. and they brought near the hegoats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly and they laid their hands upon them and the priests killed them and they made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar to make atonement for all israel for the king commanded [that] the burnt offering and the sinoffering [should be made] for all israel. and he set the levites in the house of jehovah with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for the commandment was of jehovah by his prophets. and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets.  and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. and when the burntoffering began the song of jehovah began also and the trumpets together with the instruments of david king of israel. and all the assembly worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded all this [continued] until the burntoffering was finished. and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped. moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praises unto jehovah with the words of david and of asaph the seer. and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped. then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto jehovah come near and bring sacrifices and thankofferings into the house of jehovah. and the assembly brought in sacrifices and thankofferings and as many as were of a willing heart [brought] burntofferings.  and the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks a hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to jehovah. and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burntofferings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. and also the burntofferings were in abundance with the fat of the peaceofferings and with the drinkofferings for every burnt offering. so the service of the house of jehovah was set in order. and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people because of that which god had prepared for the people for the thing was done suddenly. and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of jehovah at jerusalem to keep the passover unto jehovah the god of israel.  for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the assembly in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month.  for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem. and the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly. so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beer sheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto jehovah the god of israel at jerusalem for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written. so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto jehovah the god of abraham isaac and israel that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of assyria.  and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren who trespassed against jehovah the god of their fathers so that he gave them up to desolation as ye see. now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto jehovah and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve jehovah your god that his fierce anger may turn away from you.  for if ye turn again unto jehovah your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive and shall come again into this land for jehovah your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him. so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them. nevertheless certain men of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem. also upon judah came the hand of god to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of jehovah.  and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great assembly. and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron. then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of jehovah. and they stood in their place after their order according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] of the hand of the levites. for there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves therefore the levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto jehovah. for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. for hezekiah had prayed for them saying the good jehovah pardon every one  that setteth his heart to seek god jehovah the god of his fathers though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary. and jehovah hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people. and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised jehovah day by day [singing] with loud instruments unto jehovah. and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that had good understanding [in the service] of jehovah. so they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days offering sacrifices of peace offerings and making confession to jehovah the god of their fathers. and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept [other] seven days with gladness. for hezekiah king of judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.  and all the assembly of judah with the priests and the levites and all the assembly that came out of israel and the sojourners that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced. so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem. then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy habitation even unto heaven. now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake in pieces the pillars and hewed down the asherim and brake down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had destroyed them all. then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities. and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service both the priests and the levites for burntofferings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of jehovah.  [he appointed] also the kings portion of his substance for the burntofferings [to wit] for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burntofferings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of jehovah. moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might give themselves to the law of jehovah. and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain new wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. and the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto jehovah their god and laid them by heaps. in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month. and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed jehovah and his people israel. then hezekiah questioned the priests and the levites concerning the heaps.  and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since [the people] began to bring the oblations into the house of jehovah we have eaten and had enough and have left plenty for jehovah hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store. then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of jehovah and they prepared them. and they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully and over them conaniah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was second. and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of conaniah and shimei his brother by the appointment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god. and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter at the east [gate] was over the freewillofferings of god to distribute the oblations of jehovah and the most holy things.  and under him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their office of trust to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males from three years old and upward even every one that entered into the house of jehovah as the duty of every day required for their service in their offices according to their courses and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers houses and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their offices by their courses and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness. also for the sons of aaron the priests that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every city there were men that were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the levites.  and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before jehovah his god. and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered. after these things and this faithfulness sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fortified cities and thought to win them for himself. and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they helped him. so there was gathered much people together and they stopped all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water  and he took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down and raised [it] up to the towers and the other wall without and strengthened millo [in] the city of david and made weapons and shields in abundance. and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying be strong and of good courage be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there is a greater with us than with him with him is an arm of flesh but with us is jehovah our god to help us and to fight our battles. and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah. after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem now he was before lachish and all his power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide the siege in jerusalem  doth not hezekiah persuade you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst saying jehovah our god will deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and upon it shall ye burn incense know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of my hand now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you after this manner neither believe ye him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of my hand and his servants spake yet more against jehovah god and against his servant hezekiah.  he wrote also letters to rail on jehovah the god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of the lands which have not delivered their people out of my hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand. and they cried with a loud voice in the jews language unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city. and they spake of the god of jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of mens hands. and hezekiah the king and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz prayed because of this and cried to heaven. and jehovah sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria. so he returned with shame of face to his own land. and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.  thus jehovah saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all [others] and guided them on every side. and many brought gifts unto jehovah to jerusalem and precious things to hezekiah king of judah so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. in those days hezekiah was sick even unto death and he prayed unto jehovah and he spake unto him and gave him a sign. but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem. notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of jehovah came not upon them in the days of hezekiah. and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor and he provided him treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of goodly vessels  storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and flocks in folds. moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him very much substance. this same hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of gihon and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of david. and hezekiah prospered in all his works. howbeit in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart. now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his good deeds behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz in the book of the kings of judah and israel. and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honor at his death. and manasseh his son reigned in his stead.  manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah after the abominations of the nations whom jehovah cast out before the children of israel. for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for the baalim and made asheroth and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them. and he built altars in the house of jehovah whereof jehovah said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever. and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of jehovah. he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom and he practised augury and used enchantments and practised sorcery and dealt with them that had familiar spirits and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of jehovah to provoke him to anger.  and he set the graven image of the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from off the land which i have appointed for your fathers if only they will observe to do all that i have commanded them even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances [given] by moses. and manasseh seduced judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that they did evil more than did the nations whom jehovah destroyed before the children of israel. and jehovah spake to manasseh and to his people but they gave no heed. wherefore jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria who took manasseh in chains and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon. and when he was in distress he besought jehovah his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers.  and he prayed unto him and he was entreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom. then manasseh knew that jehovah he was god. now after this he built an outer wall to the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entrance at the fish gate and he compassed ophel about [with it] and raised it up to a very great height and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of judah. and he took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of jehovah and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city. and he built up the altar of jehovah and offered thereon sacrifices of peaceofferings and of thanksgiving and commanded judah to serve jehovah the god of israel. nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places but only unto jehovah their god. now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of jehovah the god of israel behold they are written among the acts of the kings of israel.  his prayer also and how [god] was entreated of him and all his sin and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up the asherim and the graven images before he humbled himself behold they are written in the history of hozai. so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead. amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah as did manasseh his father and amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which manasseh his father had made and served them. and he humbled not himself before jehovah as manasseh his father had humbled himself but this same amon trespassed more and more. and his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house. but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead. josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem.  and he did that which was right in the eyes of jehovah and walked in the ways of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the asherim and the graven images and the molten images. and they brake down the altars of the baalim in his presence and the sunimages that were on high above them he hewed down and the asherim and the graven images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves [of them] that had sacrificed unto them.  and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and purged judah and jerusalem. and [so did he] in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali in their ruins round about. and he brake down the altars and beat the asherim and the graven images into powder and hewed down all the sunimages throughout all the land of israel and returned to jerusalem.  now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of jehovah his god. and they came to hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites the keepers of the threshold had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and of the inhabitants of jerusalem. and they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of jehovah and the workmen that wrought in the house of jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed.  and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and [others of] the levites all that were skilful with instruments of music. also they were over the bearers of burdens and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters. and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of jehovah hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of jehovah [given] by moses. and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of jehovah. and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan. and shaphan carried the book to the king and moreover brought back word to the king saying all that was committed to thy servants they are doing. and they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of jehovah and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen.  and shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. and shaphan read therein before the king. and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes. and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying go ye inquire of jehovah for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of jehovah that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of jehovah to do according unto all that is written in this book. so hilkiah and they whom the king [had commanded] went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tokhath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the second quarter and they spake to her to that effect. and she said unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel tell ye the man that sent you unto me  thus saith jehovah behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah. because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place and it shall not be quenched. but unto the king of judah who sent you to inquire of jehovah thus shall ye say to him thus saith jehovah the god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard because thy heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and hast humbled thyself before me and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith jehovah. behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof. and they brought back word to the king.  then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem. and the king went up to the house of jehovah and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people both great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of jehovah. and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before jehovah to walk after jehovah and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. and he caused all that were found in jerusalem and benjamin to stand [to it]. and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers. and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were found in israel to serve even to serve jehovah their god. all his days they departed not from following jehovah the god of their fathers.  and josiah kept a passover unto jehovah in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month. and he set the priests in their offices and encouraged them to the service of the house of jehovah. and he said unto the levites that taught all israel that were holy unto jehovah put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders now serve jehovah your god and his people israel. and prepare yourselves after your fathers houses by your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son. and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren the children of the people and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers house of the levites. and kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of jehovah by moses.  and josiah gave to the children of the people of the flock lambs and kids all of them for the passover offerings unto all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the kings substance. and his princes gave for a freewilloffering unto the people to the priests and to the levites. hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel the rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle] and three hundred oxen. conaniah also and shemaiah and nethanel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad the chiefs of the levites gave unto the levites for the passover offerings five thousand [small cattle] and five hundred oxen. so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites by their courses according to the kings commandment. and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] of their hand and the levites flayed them.  and they removed the burntofferings that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers houses of the children of the people to offer unto jehovah as it is written in the book of moses. and so did they with the oxen. and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance and the holy offerings boiled they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. and afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron. and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the porters were at every gate they needed not to depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them.  so all the service of jehovah was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of jehovah according to the commandment of king josiah. and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did any of the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem. in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept. after all this when josiah had prepared the temple neco king of egypt went up to fight against carchemish by the euphrates and josiah went out against him. but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah [i come] not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war and god hath commanded me to make haste forbear thee from [meddling with] god who is with me that he destroy thee not.  nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of neco from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo. and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded. so his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah. and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations unto this day and they made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations. now the rest of the acts of josiah and his good deeds according to that which is written in the law of jehovah and his acts first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah. then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem.  joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem. and the king of egypt deposed him at jerusalem and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and changed his name to jehoiakim. and neco took joahaz his brother and carried him to egypt. jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah his god. against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon. nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of jehovah to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon. now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.  jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah. and at the return of the year king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of jehovah and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem. zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah his god he humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet [speaking] from the mouth of jehovah. and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning unto jehovah the god of israel. moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations and they polluted the house of jehovah which he had hallowed in jerusalem.  and jehovah the god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up early and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of jehovah arose against his people till there was no remedy. therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or virgin old man or hoaryheaded he gave them all into his hand. and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon. and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia  to fulfil the word of jehovah by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths [for] as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years. now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of jehovah by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished jehovah stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and [put it] also in writing saying thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath jehovah the god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah. whosoever there is among you of all his people jehovah his god be with him and let him go up. now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of jehovah by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished jehovah stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and [put it] also in writing saying thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath jehovah the god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah.  whosoever there is among you of all his people his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of jehovah the god of israel he is god which is in jerusalem. and whosoever is left in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts besides the freewilloffering for the house of god which is in jerusalem. then rose up the heads of fathers [houses] of judah and benjamin and the priests and the levites even all whose spirit god had stirred to go up to build the house of jehovah which is in jerusalem. and all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with precious things besides all that was willingly offered. also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of jehovah which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had put in the house of his gods even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah.  and this is the number of them thirty platters of gold a thousand platters of silver nine and twenty knives thirty bowls of gold silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels a thousand. all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. all these did sheshbazzar bring up when they of the captivity were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem. now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and that returned unto jerusalem and judah every one unto his city who came with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah seraiah reelaiah mordecai bilshan mispar bigvai rehum baanah. the number of the men of the people of israel the children of parosh two

of giddel the children of shephatiah the children of hattil the children of pochereth hazzebaim the children of ami. all the nethinim and the children of solomons servants were three hundred ninety and two. and these were they that went up from telmelah telharsha cherub addan [and] immer but they could not show their fathers houses and their seed whether they were of israel the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred fifty and two. and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name.  these sought their register [among] those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. and the governor said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim.  the whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore besides their menservants and their maid servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five their camels four hundred thirty and five [their] asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty. and some of the heads of fathers [houses] when they came to the house of jehovah which is in jerusalem offered willingly for the house of god to set it up in its place they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold and five thousand pounds of silver and one hundred priests garments.  so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the nethinim dwelt in their cities and all israel in their cities. and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem. then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burntofferings thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god.  and they set the altar upon its base for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries and they offered burntofferings thereon unto jehovah even burntofferings morning and evening. and they kept the feast of tabernacles as it is written and [offered] the daily burntofferings by number according to the ordinance as the duty of every day required and afterward the continual burnt offering and [the offerings] of the new moons and of all the set feasts of jehovah that were consecrated and of every one that willingly offered a freewilloffering unto jehovah.  from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burntofferings unto jehovah but the foundation of the temple of jehovah was not yet laid. they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and food and drink and oil unto them of sidon and to them of tyre to bring cedartrees from lebanon to the sea unto joppa according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia.  now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the rest of their brethren the priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to have the oversight of the work of the house of jehovah. then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his sons the sons of judah together to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren the levites.  and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of jehovah they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise jehovah after the order of david king of israel. and they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto jehovah [saying] for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever toward israel. and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised jehovah because the foundation of the house of jehovah was laid. but many of the priests and levites and heads of fathers [houses] the old men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off. now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto jehovah the god of israel  then they drew near to zerubbabel and to the heads of fathers [houses] and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as ye do and we sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assyria who brought us up hither. but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers [houses] of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto jehovah the god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us. then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia. and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem. and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of his companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian [character] and set forth in the syrian [tongue].  rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort then [wrote] rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites and the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the shushanchites the dehaites the elamites and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble osnappar brought over and set in the city of samaria and in the rest [of the country] beyond the river and so forth. this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto artaxerxes the king thy servants the men beyond the river and so forth. be it known unto the king that the jews that came up from thee are come to us unto jerusalem they are building the rebellious and the bad city and have finished the walls and repaired the foundations. be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls finished they will not pay tribute custom or toll and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings. now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not meet for us to see the kings dishonor therefore have we sent and certified the king  that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city laid waste. we certify the king that if this city be builded and the walls finished by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the river. [then] sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria and in the rest [of the country] beyond the river peace and so forth. the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. and i decreed and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem who have ruled over all [the country] beyond the river and tribute custom and toll was paid unto them. make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until a decree shall be made by me.  and take heed that ye be not slack herein why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings then when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power. then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem and it ceased until the second year of the reign of darius king of persia. now the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel [prophesied they] unto them. then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them. at the same time came to them tattenai the governor beyond the river and shetharbozenai and their companions and said thus unto them who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall then we told them after this manner what the names of the men were that were making this building.  but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews and they did not make them cease till the matter should come to darius and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it. the copy of the letter that tattenai the governor beyond the river and shetharbozenai and his companions the apharsachites who were beyond the river sent unto darius the king they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all peace. be it known unto the king that we went into the province of judah to the house of the great god which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall we asked them their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them. and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and are building the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and finished.  but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into babylon. but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of god. and the gold and silver vessels also of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor and he said unto him take these vessels go put them in the temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in its place. then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundations of the house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not completed.  now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the kings treasurehouse which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the archives where the treasures were laid up in babylon. and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the province of media a roll and therein was thus written for a record in the first year of cyrus the king cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offer sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits with three courses of great stones and a course of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the kings house.  and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem every one to its place and thou shalt put them in the house of god. now therefore tattenai governor beyond the river shetharbozenai and your companions the apharsachites who are beyond the river be ye far from thence let the work of this house of god alone let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in its place. moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the jews for the building of this house of god that of the kings goods even of the tribute beyond the river expenses be given with all diligence unto these men that they be not hindered. and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for burntofferings to the god of heaven [also] wheat salt wine and oil according to the word of the priests that are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail  that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons. also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let a beam be pulled out from his house and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter [the same] to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem. i darius have made a decree let it be done with all diligence. then tattenai the governor beyond the river shetharbozenai and their companions because that darius the king had sent did accordingly with all diligence. and the elders of the jews builded and prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo. and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the god of israel and according to the decree of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia. and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king.  and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of god with joy. and they offered at the dedication of this house of god a hundred bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sinoffering for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes of israel. and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses. and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month. for the priests and the levites had purified themselves together all of them were pure and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves. and the children of israel that were come again out of the captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land to seek jehovah the god of israel did eat  and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for jehovah had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god the god of israel. now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses which jehovah the god of israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of jehovah his god upon him. and there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinim unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king. and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king.  for upon the first [day] of the first month began he to go up from babylon and on the first [day] of the fifth month came he to jerusalem according to the good hand of his god upon him. for ezra had set his heart to seek the law of jehovah and to do it and to teach in israel statutes and ordinances. now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest the scribe even the scribe of the words of the commandments of jehovah and of his statutes to israel artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect and so forth. i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and their priests and the levites in my realm that are minded of their own free will to go to jerusalem go with thee. forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors to inquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to the law of thy god which is in thy hand and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem  and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of babylon with the freewilloffering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks rams lambs with their mealofferings and their drink offerings and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem. and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do ye after the will of your god. and the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god deliver thou before the god of jerusalem. and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the kings treasurehouse. and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of you it be done with all diligence  unto a hundred talents of silver and to a hundred measures of wheat and to a hundred baths of wine and to a hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much. whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be done exactly for the house of the god of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons also we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites the singers porters nethinim or servants of this house of god it shall not be lawful to impose tribute custom or toll upon them. and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thy hand appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people that are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach ye him that knoweth them not. and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the king let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment.  blessed be jehovah the god of our fathers who hath put such a thing as this in the kings heart to beautify the house of jehovah which is in jerusalem and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king and his counsellors and before all the kings mighty princes. and i was strengthened according to the hand of jehovah my god upon me and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me. now these are the heads of their fathers [houses] and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign of artaxerxes the king  of the sons of phinehas gershom. of the sons of ithamar daniel. of the sons of david hattush. of the sons of shecaniah of the sons of parosh zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty. of the sons of pahathmoab eliehoenai the son of zerahiah and with him two hundred males. of the sons of shecaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three hundred males. and of the sons of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him fifty males.  and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with him seventy males. and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him fourscore males. of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males. and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him a hundred and threescore males. and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with him twenty and eight males. and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with him a hundred and ten males. and of the sons of adonikam [that were] the last and these are their names eliphelet jeuel and shemaiah and with them threescore males.  and of the sons of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males. and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava and there we encamped three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi.  then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan who were teachers. and i sent them forth unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo [and] his brethren the nethinim at the place casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god. and according to the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of discretion of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty and of the nethinim whom david and the princes had given for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinim all of them were mentioned by name.  then i proclaimed a fast there at the river ahava that we might humble ourselves before our god to seek of him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance.  for i was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them that seek him for good but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was entreated of us. then i set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests even sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering for the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his princes and all israel there present had offered i weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels a hundred talents of gold a hundred talents and twenty bowls of gold of a thousand darics and two vessels of fine bright brass precious as gold. and i said unto them ye are holy unto jehovah and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are a freewilloffering unto jehovah the god of your fathers.  watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the levites and the princes of the fathers [houses] of israel at jerusalem in the chambers of the house of jehovah. so the priests and the levites received the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house of our god. then we departed from the river ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lierinwait by the way. and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days. and on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our god into the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui the levite the whole by number and by weight and all the weight was written at that time.  the children of the captivity that were come out of exile offered burntofferings unto the god of israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve hegoats for a sinoffering all this was a burntoffering unto jehovah. and they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings satraps and to the governors beyond the river and they furthered the people and the house of god. now when these things were done the princes drew near unto me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands [doing] according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites. for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my robe and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down confounded.  then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the trespass of them of the captivity and i sat confounded until the evening oblation. and at the evening oblation i arose up from my humiliation even with my garment and my robe rent and i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto jehovah my god and i said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens. since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to plunder and to confusion of face as it is this day. and now for a little moment grace hath been showed from jehovah our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.  for we are bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the ruins thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem. and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands through their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such a remnant  shall we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor any to escape o jehovah the god of israel thou art righteous for we are left a remnant that is escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our guiltiness for none can stand before thee because of this. now while ezra prayed and made confession weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there was gathered together unto him out of israel a very great assembly of men and women and children for the people wept very sore. and shecaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land yet now there is hope for israel concerning this thing. now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law.  arise for the matter belongeth unto thee and we are with thee be of good courage and do it. then arose ezra and made the chiefs of the priests the levites and all israel to swear that they would do according to this word. so they sware. then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of jehohanan the son of eliashib and [when] he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity. and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem and that whosoever came not within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity. then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within the three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth [day] of the month and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain.  and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have trespassed and have married foreign women to increase the guilt of israel. now therefore make confession unto jehovah the god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women. then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said concerning us so must we do. but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god be turned from us until this matter be despatched. only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah stood up against this [matter] and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them.  and the children of the captivity did so. and ezra the priest [with] certain heads of fathers [houses] after their fathers houses and all of them by their names were set apart and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. and they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month. and among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women [namely] of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah. and they gave their hand that they would put away their wives and being guilty [they offered] a ram of the flock for their guilt. and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah. and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah. and of the sons of pashhur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethanel jozabad and elasah. and of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah the same is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer.  and of the singers eliashib. and of the porters shallum and telem and uri. and of israel of the sons of parosh ramiah and izziah and malchijah and mijamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah. and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and elijah. and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza. and of the sons of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai athlai. and of the sons of bani meshullam malluch and adaiah jashub and sheal jeremoth. and of the sons of pahathmoab adna and chelal benaiah maaseiah mattaniah bezalel and binnui and manasseh. and [of] the sons of harim eliezer isshijah malchijah shemaiah shimeon benjamin malluch shemariah. of the sons of hashum mattenai mattattah zabad eliphelet jeremai manasseh shimei. of the sons of bani maadai amram and uel benaiah bedeiah cheluhi vaniah meremoth eliashib  mattaniah mattenai and jaasu and bani and binnui shimei and shelemiah and nathan and adaiah machnadebai shashai sharai azarel and shelemiah shemariah shallum amariah joseph. of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina iddo and joel benaiah. all these had taken foreign wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children. the words of nehemiah the son of hacaliah. now it came to pass in the month chislev in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men out of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped that were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem. and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire. and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and i fasted and prayed before the god of heaven  and said i beseech thee o jehovah the god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee at this time day and night for the children of israel thy servants while i confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee. yea i and my fathers house have sinned we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the ordinances which thou commandedst thy servant moses. remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye trespass i will scatter you abroad among the peoples but if ye return unto me and keep my commandments and do them though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.  now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand. o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. now i was cupbearer to the king. and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king when wine was before him that i took up the wine and gave it unto the king. now i had not been [beforetime] sad in his presence. and the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. then i was very sore afraid. and i said unto the king let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven.  and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build it. and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time. moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may let me pass through till i come unto judah and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into. and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me. then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the kings letters. now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. and when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel.  so i came to jerusalem and was there three days. and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god put into my heart to do for jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon. and i went out by night by the valley gate even toward the jackals well and to the dung gate and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. then i went on to the fountain gate and to the kings pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and i turned back and entered by the valley gate and so returned. and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work. then said i unto them ye see the evil case that we are in how jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a reproach.  and i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as also of the kings words that he had spoken unto me. and they said let us rise up and build. so they strengthened their hands for the good [work]. but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king then answered i them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem. then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set up the doors of it even unto the tower

pass that when sanballat heard that we were building the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews. and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what are these feeble jews doing will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish seeing they are burned now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they are building if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall. hear o our god for we are despised and turn back their reproach upon their own head and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders. so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together unto half [the height] thereof for the people had a mind to work.  but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of jerusalem went forward [and] that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wroth and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against jerusalem and to cause confusion therein. but we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them. and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall. and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come into the midst of them and slay them and cause the work to cease. and it came to pass that when the jews that dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places ye must return unto us. therefore set i in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall in the open places i set [there] the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows.  and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord who is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses. and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned all of us to the wall every one unto his work. and it came to pass from that time forth that half of my servants wrought in the work and half of them held the spears the shields and the bows and the coats of mail and the rulers were behind all the house of judah. they all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other held his weapon and the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and so builded. and he that sounded the trumpet was by me. and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another  in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto us our god will fight for us. so we wrought in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and may labor in the day. so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard that followed me none of us put off our clothes every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water. then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews. for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are many let us get grain that we may eat and live. some also there were that said we are mortgaging our fields and our vineyards and our houses let us get grain because of the dearth. there were also that said we have borrowed money for the kings tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.  yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already] neither is it in our power to help it for other men have our fields and our vineyards. and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words. then i consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother. and i held a great assembly against them. and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews that were sold unto the nations and would ye even sell your brethren and should they be sold unto us then held they their peace and found never a word. also i said the thing that ye do is not good ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the nations our enemies and i likewise my brethren and my servants do lend them money and grain. i pray you let us leave off this usury.  restore i pray you to them even this day their fields their vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain the new wine and the oil that ye exact of them. then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do even as thou sayest. then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they would do according to this promise. also i shook out my lap and said so god shake out every man from his house and from his labor that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied. and all the assembly said amen and praised jehovah. and the people did according to this promise. moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king [that is] twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. but the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people and took of them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not i because of the fear of god.  yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. moreover there were at my table of the jews and the rulers a hundred and fifty men besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us. now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this i demanded not the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people. remember unto me o my god for good all that i have done for this people. now it came to pass when it was reported to sanballat and tobiah and to geshem the arabian and unto the rest of our enemies that i had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though even unto that time i had not set up the doors in the gates that sanballat and geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of ono. but they thought to do me mischief.  and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave it and come down to you and they sent unto me four times after this sort and i answered them after the same manner. then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand wherein was written it is reported among the nations and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou art building the wall and thou wouldest be their king according to these words. and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. come now therefore and let us take counsel together. then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. for they all would have made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done. but now [o god] strengthen thou my hands.  and i went unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabel who was shut up and he said let us meet together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee. and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that being such as i would go into the temple to save his life i will not go in. and i discerned and lo god had not sent him but he pronounced this prophecy against me and tobiah and sanballat had hired him. for this cause was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me. remember o my god tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and also the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear. so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] elul in fifty and two days.  and it came to pass when all our enemies heard [thereof] that all the nations that were about us feared and were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god. moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and [the letters] of tobiah came unto them. for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the soninlaw of shecaniah the son of arah and his son jehohanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah to wife. also they spake of his good deeds before me and reported my words to him. [and] tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the governor of the castle charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many.  and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand [on guard] let them shut the doors and bar ye them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one [to be] over against his house. now the city was wide and large but the people were few therein and the houses were not builded. and my god put into my heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy. and i found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first and i found written therein these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and that returned unto jerusalem and to judah every one unto his city who came with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah azariah raamiah nahamani mordecai bilshan mispereth bigvai nehum baanah. the number of the men of the people of israel the children of parosh two thousand a hundred and seventy and

children of giddel the children of shephatiah the children of hattil the children of pochereth hazzebaim the children of amon. all the nethinim and the children of solomons servants were three hundred ninety and two. and these were they that went up from telmelah telharsha cherub addon and immer but they could not show their fathers houses nor their seed whether they were of israel the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred forty and two. and of the priests the children of hobaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name.  these sought their register [among] those that were reckoned by genealogy but it was not found therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. and the governor said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim. the whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore besides their menservants and their maid servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five [their] camels four hundred thirty and five [their] asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty. and some from among the heads of fathers [houses] gave unto the work. the governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold fifty basins five hundred and thirty priests garments.  and some of the heads of fathers [houses] gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand pounds of silver and threescore and seven priests garments. so the priests and the levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the nethinim and all israel dwelt in their cities. and when the seventh month was come the children of israel were in their cities. and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which jehovah had commanded to israel.  and ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly both men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month. and he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday in the presence of the men and the women and of those that could understand and the ears of all the people were [attentive] unto the book of the law.  and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and uriah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchijah and hashum and hashbaddanah zechariah [and] meshullam. and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up and ezra blessed jehovah the great god. and all the people answered amen amen with the lifting up of their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped jehovah with their faces to the ground.  also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai hodiah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people [stood] in their place. and they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and they gave the sense so that they understood the reading.  and nehemiah who was the governor and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto jehovah your god mourn not nor weep. for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye grieved for the joy of jehovah is your strength. so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grieved. and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. and on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers [houses] of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the scribe even to give attention to the words of the law.  and they found written in the law how that jehovah had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month  and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and branches of wild olive and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written. so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the broad place of the water gate and in the broad place of the gate of ephraim. and all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and dwelt in the booths for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so. and there was very great gladness. also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god. and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the ordinance. now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting and with sackcloth and earth upon them.  and the seed of israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of jehovah their god a fourth part of the day and [another] fourth part they confessed and worshipped jehovah their god. then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani [and] chenani and cried with a loud voice unto jehovah their god. then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabneiah sherebiah hodiah shebaniah [and] pethahiah said stand up and bless jehovah your god from everlasting to everlasting and blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise. thou art jehovah even thou alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are thereon the seas and all that is in them and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.  thou art jehovah the god who didst choose abram and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name of abraham and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanite the hittite the amorite and the perizzite and the jebusite and the girgashite to give it unto his seed and hast performed thy words for thou art righteous. and thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea and showedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them and didst get thee a name as it is this day. and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths as a stone into the mighty waters. moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light in the way wherein they should go.  thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right ordinances and true laws good statutes and commandments and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them commandments and statutes and a law by moses thy servant and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck and hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their neck and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and forsookest them not. yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great provocations  yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light and the way wherein they should go. thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst. yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness [and] they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not. moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples which thou didst allot after their portions so they possessed the land of sihon even the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan. their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers that they should go in to possess it. so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the peoples of the land that they might do with them as they would.  and they took fortified cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all good things cisterns hewn out vineyards and oliveyards and fruittrees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their back and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee and they wrought great provocations. therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries who distressed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. but after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies  and testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thine ordinances which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear. yet many years didst thou bear with them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit through thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god. now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible god who keepest covenant and lovingkindness let not all the travail seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day. howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us for thou hast dealt truly but we have done wickedly  neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them. for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works. behold we are servants this day and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in it. and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress. and yet for all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes our levites [and] our priests seal unto it. now those that sealed were nehemiah the governor the son of hacaliah and zedekiah seraiah azariah jeremiah pashhur amariah malchijah hattush shebaniah malluch harim meremoth obadiah  daniel ginnethon baruch meshullam abijah mijamin maaziah bilgai shemaiah these were the priests. and the levites namely jeshua the son of azaniah binnui of the sons of henadad kadmiel and their brethren

maaseiah and ahiah hanan anan malluch harim baanah.  and the rest of the people the priests the levites the porters the singers the nethinim and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of god their wives their sons and their daughters every one that had knowledge and understanding they clave to their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in gods law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and do all the commandments of jehovah our lord and his ordinances and his statutes and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell that we would not buy of them on the sabbath or on a holy day and that we would forego the seventh year and the exaction of every debt. also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god  for the showbread and for the continual mealoffering and for the continual burnt offering for the sabbaths for the new moons for the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sinofferings to make atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our god. and we cast lots the priests the levites and the people for the woodoffering to bring it into the house of our god according to our fathers houses at times appointed year by year to burn upon the altar of jehovah our god as it is written in the law and to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all manner of trees year by year unto the house of jehovah also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is written in the law and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks to bring to the house of our god unto the priests that minister in the house of our god  and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough and our heaveofferings and the fruit of all manner of trees the new wine and the oil unto the priests to the chambers of the house of our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites for they the levites take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the treasure house. for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring the heaveoffering of the grain of the new wine and of the oil unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that minister and the porters and the singers and we will not forsake the house of our god. and the princes of the people dwelt in jerusalem the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy city and nine parts in the [other] cities. and the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in jerusalem.  now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in jerusalem but in the cities of judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities [to wit] israel the priests and the levites and the nethinim and the children of solomons servants. and in jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of judah and of the children of benjamin. of the children of judah athaiah the son of uzziah the son of

seventy and two. and the residue of israel of the priests the levites were in all the cities of judah every one in his inheritance. but the nethinim dwelt in ophel and ziha and gishpa were over the nethinim. the overseer also of the levites at jerusalem was uzzi the son of bani the son of hashabiah the son of mattaniah the son of mica of the sons of asaph the singers over the business of the house of god. for there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a settled provision for the singers as every day required. and pethahiah the son of meshezabel of the children of zerah the son of judah was at the kings hand in all matters concerning the people. and as for the villages with their fields some of the children of judah dwelt in kiriatharba and the towns thereof and in dibon

neballat lod and ono the valley of craftsmen. and of the levites certain courses in judah [were joined] to benjamin. now these are the priests and the levites that went up with zerubbabel the son of

joiarib mattenai of jedaiah uzzi of sallai kallai of amok eber of hilkiah hashabiah of jedaiah nethanel. as for the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and jaddua there were recorded the heads of fathers [houses] also the priests in the reign of darius the persian.  the sons of levi heads of fathers [houses] were written in the book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib. and the chiefs of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of god watch next to watch.  mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were porters keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates. these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the priest the scribe. and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with singing with cymbals psalteries and with harps. and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both out of the plain round about jerusalem and from the villages of the netophathites  also from beth gilgal and out of the fields of geba and azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages round about jerusalem. and the priests and the levites purified themselves and they purified the people and the gates and the wall. then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession [whereof one went] on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate  and after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah and azariah ezra and meshullam judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah and certain of the priests sons with trumpets zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of micaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph and his brethren shemaiah and azarel milalai gilalai maai nethanel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe was before them.  and by the fountain gate and straight before them they went up by the stairs of the city of david at the ascent of the wall above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward. and the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them and i after them with the half of the people upon the wall above the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall and above the gate of ephraim and by the old gate and by the fish gate and the tower of hananel and the tower of hammeah even unto the sheep gate and they stood still in the gate of the guard.  so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of god and i and the half of the rulers with me and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin micaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with trumpets and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer. and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer.  and they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced for god had made them rejoice with great joy and the women also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off. and on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures for the heave offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes to gather into them according to the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites that waited. and they kept the charge of their god and the charge of the purification and [so did] the singers and the porters according to the commandment of david and of solomon his son. for in the days of david and asaph of old there was a chief of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god. and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters as every day required and they set apart [that which was] for the levites and the levites set apart [that which was] for the sons of aaron.  on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that an ammonite and a moabite should not enter into the assembly of god for ever because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them to curse them howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing. and it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude. now before this eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our god being allied unto tobiah had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meal offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the grain the new wine and the oil which were given by commandment to the levites and the singers and the porters and the heave offerings for the priests. but in all this [time] i was not at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon i went unto the king and after certain days asked i leave of the king  and i came to jerusalem and understood the evil that eliashib had done for tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god. and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber. then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the mealofferings and the frankincense. and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them so that the levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his field. then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their place. then brought all judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.  remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the observances thereof. in those days saw i in judah some men treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses [therewith] as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals. there dwelt men of tyre also therein who brought in fish and all manner of wares and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah and in jerusalem. then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath.  and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the doors should be shut and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set i over the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. so the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without jerusalem once or twice. then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you. from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. and i commanded the levites that they should purify themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day. remember unto me o my god this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness. in those days also saw i the jews that had married women of ashdod of ammon [and] of moab and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people.  and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god [saying] ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him and he was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin. shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to trespass against our god in marrying foreign women and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son inlaw to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me. remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites. thus cleansed i them from all foreigners and appointed charges for the priests and for the levites every one in his work and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits. remember me o my god for good.  now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus who reigned from india even unto ethiopia over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even a hundred and fourscore days. and when these days were fulfilled the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings palace. [there were hangings of] white [cloth] [of] green and [of] blue fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the couches were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and white and yellow and black marble.  and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king. and the drinking was according to the law none could compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every mans pleasure. also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus. on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of ahasuerus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the peoples and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on. but the queen vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by the chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him. then the king said to the wise men who knew the times for so was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment  and the next unto him were carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media who saw the kings face and sat first in the kingdom what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not done the bidding of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus. for this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not. and this day will the princesses of persia and media who have heard of the deed of the queen say [the like] unto all the kings princes. so [will there arise] much contempt and wrath.  if it please the king let there go forth a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. and when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom for it is great all the wives will give to their husbands honor both to great and small. and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan for he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and should speak according to the language of his people. after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was pacified he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her. then said the kings servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king  and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hegai the kings chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti. and the thing pleased the king and he did so. there was a certain jew in shushan the palace whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away. and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncles daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maiden was fair and beautiful and when her father and mother were dead mordecai took her for his own daughter.  so it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was taken into the kings house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women. and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with her portions and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the kings house and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women. esther had not made known her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known. and mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens house to know how esther did and what would become of her. now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months for so were the days of their purifications accomplished [to wit] six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women  then in this wise came the maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house. in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the kings chamberlain who kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and she were called by name. now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the kings chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed. and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her. so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign. and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti.  then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esthers feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king. and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai was sitting in the kings gate. esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him. in those days while mordecai was sitting in the kings gate two of the kings chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those that kept the threshold were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus. and the thing became known to mordecai who showed it unto esther the queen and esther told the king [thereof] in mordecais name. and when inquisition was made of the matter and it was found to be so they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.  after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. and all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowed down and did reverence to haman for the king had so commanded concerning him. but mordecai bowed not down nor did him reverence. then the kings servants that were in the kings gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the kings commandment now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecais matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew. and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not down nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath. but he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had made known to him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai.  in the first month which is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month [to] the twelfth [month] which is the month adar. and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people neither keep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profit to suffer them. if it please the king let it be written that they be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the [kings] business to bring it into the kings treasuries. and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy. and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.  then were the kings scribes called in the first month on the thirteenth day thereof and there was written according to all that haman commanded unto the kings satraps and to the governors that were over every province and to the princes of every people to every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and it was sealed with the kings ring. and letters were sent by posts into all the kings provinces to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey. a copy of the writing that the decree should be given out in every province was published unto all the peoples that they should be ready against that day. the posts went forth in haste by the kings commandment and the decree was given out in shushan the palace. and the king and haman sat down to drink but the city of shushan was perplexed.  now when mordecai knew all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry and he came even before the kings gate for none might enter within the kings gate clothed with sackcloth. and in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. and esthers maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her and the queen was exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take his sackcloth from off him but he received it not.  then called esther for hathach one of the kings chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and charged him to go to mordecai to know what this was and why it was. so hathach went forth to mordecai unto the broad place of the city which was before the kings gate.  and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and the exact sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the jews to destroy them. also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in shushan to destroy them to show it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people. and hathach came and told esther the words of mordecai. then esther spake unto hathach and gave him a message unto mordecai [saying] all the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law for him that he be put to death except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.  and they told to mordecai esthers words.  then mordecai bade them return answer unto esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews. for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then will relief and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy fathers house will perish and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this then esther bade them return answer unto mordecai go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast in like manner and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish. so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him. now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the entrance of the house.  and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre. then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom. and esther said if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him. then the king said cause haman to make haste that it may be done as esther hath said. so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared. and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. then answered esther and said my petition and my request is if i have found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do tomorrow as the king hath said.  then went haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart but when haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was filled with wrath against mordecai. nevertheless haman refrained himself and went home and he sent and fetched his friends and zeresh his wife. and haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow also am i invited by her together with the king. yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the kings gate. then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made fifty cubits high and in the morning speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made.  on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king. and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the kings chamberlains of those that kept the threshold who had sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus. and the king said what honor and dignity hath been bestowed on mordecai for this then said the kings servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him. and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into the outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. and the kings servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court. and the king said let him come in. so haman came in. and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor now haman said in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself and haman said unto the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honor  let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and on the head of which a crown royal is set and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor. then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and caused him to ride through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor. and mordecai came again to the kings gate. but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered.  and haman recounted unto zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai before whom thou hast begun to fall be of the seed of the jews thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him. while they were yet talking with him came the kings chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared. so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen. and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish. but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my peace although the adversary could not have compensated for the kings damage.  then spake the king ahasuerus and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so and esther said an adversary and an enemy even this wicked haman. then haman was afraid before the king and the queen. and the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine [and went] into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the couch whereon esther was. then said the king will he even force the queen before me in the house as the word went out of the kings mouth they covered hamans face. then said harbonah one of the chamberlains that were before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman hath made for mordecai who spake good for the king standeth in the house of haman. and the king said hang him thereon. so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai. then was the kings wrath pacified.  on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen. and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her. and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai. and esther set mordecai over the house of haman. and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews. then the king held out to esther the golden sceptre. so esther arose and stood before the king. and she said if it please the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews that are in all the kings provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred  then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews. write ye also to the jews as it pleaseth you in the kings name and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse. then were the kings scribes called at that time in the third month sivan on the three and twentieth [day] thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the satraps and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia a hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language. and he wrote the name of king ahasuerus and sealed it with the kings ring and sent letters by post on horseback riding on swift steeds that were used in the kings service bred of the stud  wherein the king granted the jews that were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them [their] little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus [namely] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month which is the month adar. a copy of the writing that the decree should be given out in every province was published unto all the peoples and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. so the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the kings service went out being hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment and the decree was given out in shushan the palace. and mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan shouted and was glad. the jews had light and gladness and joy and honor.  and in every province and in every city whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came the jews had gladness and joy a feast and a good day. and many from among the peoples of the land became jews for the fear of the jews was fallen upon them. now in the twelfth month which is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution on the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have rule over them whereas it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples. and all the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they that did the kings business helped the jews because the fear of mordecai was fallen upon them. for mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces for the man mordecai waxed greater and greater.  and the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and with slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto them that hated them. and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha and poratha and adalia and aridatha and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vaizatha the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the jews enemy slew they but on the spoil they laid not their hand. on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king. and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what then have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done. then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews that are in shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this days decree and let hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.  and the king commanded it so to be done and a decree was given out in shushan and they hanged hamans ten sons. and the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men in shushan but on the spoil they laid not their hand. and the other jews that were in the kings provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand but on the spoil they laid not their hand. [this was done] on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. but the jews that were in shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. therefore do the jews of the villages that dwell in the unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month adar [a day of] gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another.  and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly as the days wherein the jews had rest from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor. and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had plotted against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them but when [the matter] came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he had devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.  wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur. therefore because of all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and that which had come unto them the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof and according to the appointed time thereof every year and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed. then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim. and he sent letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus [with] words of peace and truth  to confirm these days of purim in their appointed times according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed in the matter of the fastings and their cry. and the commandment of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book. and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea. and all the acts of his power and of his might and the full account of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia for mordecai the jew was next unto king ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his seed. there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and turned away from evil. and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.  his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred sheasses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. and his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burntofferings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and renounced god in their hearts. thus did job continually. now it came to pass on the day when the sons of god came to present themselves before jehovah that satan also came among them. and jehovah said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered jehovah and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.  and jehovah said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job for there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and turneth away from evil. then satan answered jehovah and said doth job fear god for nought hast not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land. but put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath and he will renounce thee to thy face. and jehovah said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thy hand. so satan went forth from the presence of jehovah. and it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house that there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the sabeans fell [upon them] and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee.  while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee.  while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made three bands and fell upon the camels and have taken them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee. while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee. then job arose and rent his robe and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and he said naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither jehovah gave and jehovah hath taken away blessed be the name of jehovah. in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly.  again it came to pass on the day when the sons of god came to present themselves before jehovah that satan came also among them to present himself before jehovah.  and jehovah said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan answered jehovah and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it. and jehovah said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job for there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and turneth away from evil and he still holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause. and satan answered jehovah and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life. but put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will renounce thee to thy face. and jehovah said unto satan behold he is in thy hand only spare his life. so satan went forth from the presence of jehovah and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith and he sat among the ashes.  then said his wife unto him dost thou still hold fast thine integrity renounce god and die.  but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips. now when jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his robe and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great. after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day. and job answered and said let the day perish wherein i was born and the night which said there is a manchild conceived.  let that day be darkness let not god from above seek for it neither let the light shine upon it. let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own let a cloud dwell upon it let all that maketh black the day terrify it. as for that night let thick darkness seize upon it let it not rejoice among the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months. lo let that night be barren let no joyful voice come therein. let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to rouse up leviathan. let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning because it shut not up the doors of my [mothers] womb nor hid trouble from mine eyes. why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost when my mother bare me why did the knees receive me or why the breast that i should suck for now should i have lain down and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest with kings and counsellors of the earth who built up waste places for themselves or with princes that had gold who filled their houses with silver  or as a hidden untimely birth i had not been as infants that never saw light. there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary are at rest. there the prisoners are at ease together they hear not the voice of the taskmaster. the small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master. wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul who long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasures who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave [why is light given] to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in for my sighing cometh before i eat and my groanings are poured out like water. for the thing which i fear cometh upon me and that which i am afraid of cometh unto me. i am not at ease neither am i quiet neither have i rest but trouble cometh. then answered eliphaz the temanite and said if one assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.  thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast made firm the feeble knees. but now it is come unto thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee and thou art troubled. is not thy fear [of god] thy confidence [and] the integrity of thy ways thy hope remember i pray thee who [ever] perished being innocent or where were the upright cut off according as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. by the breath of god they perish and by the blast of his anger are they consumed. the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken. the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a whisper thereof. in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake. then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up. it stood still but i could not discern the appearance thereof a form was before mine eyes [there was] silence and i heard a voice [saying]  shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be more pure than his maker behold he putteth no trust in his servants and his angels he chargeth with folly how much more them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust who are crushed before the moth betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed they perish for ever without any regarding it. is not their tent cord plucked up within them they die and that without wisdom. call now is there any that will answer thee and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn for vexation killeth the foolish man and jealousy slayeth the silly one. i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation. his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver them whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns and the snare gapeth for their substance. for affliction cometh not forth from the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the ground but man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.  but as for me i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause who doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without number who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fields so that he setteth up on high those that are low and those that mourn are exalted to safety. he frustrateth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. they meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night. but he saveth from the sword of their mouth even the needy from the hand of the mighty. so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty. for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole. he will deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee. in famine he will redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword.  thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. at destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. and thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace and thou shalt visit thy fold and shalt miss nothing. thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season. lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good. then job answered and said oh that my vexation were but weighed and all my calamity laid in the balances for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas therefore have my words been rash. for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me. doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodder  can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an egg my soul refuseth to touch [them] they are as loathsome food to me. oh that i might have my request and that god would grant [me] the thing that i long for even that it would please god to crush me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off and be it still my consolation yea let me exult in pain that spareth not that i have not denied the words of the holy one. what is my strength that i should wait and what is mine end that i should be patient is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass is it not that i have no help in me and that wisdom is driven quite from me to him that is ready to faint kindness [should be showed] from his friend even to him that forsaketh the fear of the almighty. my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook as the channel of brooks that pass away which are black by reason of the ice [and] wherein the snow hideth itself what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place.  the caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside they go up into the waste and perish. the caravans of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them. they were put to shame because they had hoped they came thither and were confounded. for now ye are nothing ye see a terror and are afraid. did i say give unto me or offer a present for me of your substance or deliver me from the adversarys hand or redeem me from the hand of the oppressors teach me and i will hold my peace and cause me to understand wherein i have erred. how forcible are words of uprightness but your reproof what doth it reprove do ye think to reprove words seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind yea ye would cast [lots] upon the fatherless and make merchandise of your friend. now therefore be pleased to look upon me for surely i shall not lie to your face. return i pray you let there be no injustice yea return again my cause is righteous. is there injustice on my tongue cannot my taste discern mischievous things  is there not a warfare to man upon earth and are not his days like the days of a hireling as a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow and as a hireling that looketh for his wages so am i made to possess months of misery and wearisome nights are appointed to me. when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh. my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hope. oh remember that my life is a breath mine eye shall no more see good. the eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more thine eyes shall be upon me but i shall not be. as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to sheol shall come up no more. he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more. therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul. am i a sea or a seamonster that thou settest a watch over me  when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than [these] my bones. i loathe [my life] i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity. what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment how long wilt thou not look away from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle if i have sinned what do i unto thee o thou watcher of men why hast thou set me as a mark for thee so that i am a burden to myself and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away mine iniquity for now shall i lie down in the dust and thou wilt seek me diligently but i shall not be. then answered bildad the shuhite and said how long wilt thou speak these things and [how long] shall the words of thy mouth be [like] a mighty wind doth god pervert justice or doth the almighty pervert righteousness  if thy children have sinned against him and he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression if thou wouldest seek diligently unto god and make thy supplication to the almighty if thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. and though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end would greatly increase. for inquire i pray thee of the former age and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water whilst it is yet in its greenness [and] not cut down it withereth before any [other] herb. so are the paths of all that forget god and the hope of the godless man shall perish whose confidence shall break in sunder and whose trust is a spiders web. he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold fast thereby but it shall not endure.  he is green before the sun and his shoots go forth over his garden. his roots are wrapped about the [stone] heap he beholdeth the place of stones. if he be destroyed from his place then it shall deny him [saying] i have not seen thee. behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others spring. behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he uphold the evil doers. he will yet fill thy mouth with laughter and thy lips with shouting. they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the tent of the wicked shall be no more. then job answered and said of a truth i know that it is so but how can man be just with god if he be pleased to contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand. [he is] wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and prospered [him] that removeth the mountains and they know it not when he overturneth them in his anger that shaketh the earth out of its place and the pillars thereof tremble that commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the stars  that alone stretcheth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea that maketh the bear orion and the pleiades and the chambers of the south that doeth great things past finding out yea marvellous things without number. lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not. behold he seizeth [the prey] who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou god will not withdraw his anger the helpers of rahab do stoop under him. how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words [to reason] with him whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer i would make supplication to my judge. if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he hearkened unto my voice. for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without cause. he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness. if [we speak] of strength lo [he is] mighty and if of justice who [saith he] will summon me though i be righteous mine own mouth shall condemn me though i be perfect it shall prove me perverse.  i am perfect i regard not myself i despise my life. it is all one therefore i say he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. if the scourge slay suddenly he will mock at the trial of the innocent. the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if [it be] not [he] who then is it now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey. if i say i will forget my complaint i will put off my [sad] countenance and be of good cheer i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. i shall be condemned why then do i labor in vain if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me. for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him that we should come together in judgment. there is no umpire betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both. let him take his rod away from me and let not his terror make me afraid  then would i speak and not fear him for i am not so in myself. my soul is weary of my life i will give free course to my complaint i will speak in the bitterness of my soul. i will say unto god do not condemn me show me wherefore thou contendest with me. is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seeth are thy days as the days of man or thy years as mans days that thou inquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin although thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thy hand thy hands have framed me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy me. remember i beseech thee that thou hast fashioned me as clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews. thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.  yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart i know that this is with thee if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet shall i not lift up my head being filled with ignominy and looking upon mine affliction. and if [my head] exalt itself thou huntest me as a lion and again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me. thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and warfare are with me. wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me. i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave. are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little before i go whence i shall not return [even] to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death  the land dark as midnight [the land] of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as midnight. then answered zophar the naamathite and said  should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified should thy boastings make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed for thou sayest my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes. but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom for he is manifold in understanding. know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection it is high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than sheol what canst thou know the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. if he pass through and shut up and all unto judgment then who can hinder him for he knoweth false men he seeth iniquity also even though he consider it not.  but vain man is void of understanding yea man is born [as] a wild asss colt. if thou set thy heart aright and stretch out thy hands toward him  if iniquity be in thy hand put it far away and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents. surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear for thou shalt forget thy misery thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away and [thy] life shall be clearer than the noonday though there be darkness it shall be as the morning. and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt search [about thee] and shalt take thy rest in safety. also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee. but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall have no way to flee and their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost. then job answered and said no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you. but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these i am as one that is a laughing stock to his neighbor i who called upon god and he answered the just the perfect man is a laughingstock.  in the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune it is ready for them whose foot slippeth. the tents of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure into whose hand god bringeth [abundantly]. but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the birds of the heavens and they shall tell thee or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. who knoweth not in all these that the hand of jehovah hath wrought this in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind doth not the ear try words even as the palate tasteth its food with aged men is wisdom and in length of days understanding. with [god] is wisdom and might he hath counsel and understanding. behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening. behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up again he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth. with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his.  he leadeth counsellors away stripped and judges maketh he fools. he looseth the bond of kings and he bindeth their loins with a girdle. he leadeth priests away stripped and overthroweth the mighty. he removeth the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the elders. he poureth contempt upon princes and looseth the belt of the strong. he uncovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. he increaseth the nations and he destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and he leadeth them captive. he taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. lo mine eye hath seen all [this] mine ear hath heard and understood it. what ye know [the same] do i know also i am not inferior unto you. surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with god. but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value.  oh that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom. hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. will ye speak unrighteously for god and talk deceitfully for him will ye show partiality to him will ye contend for god is it good that he should search you out or as one deceiveth a man will ye deceive him he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly show partiality. shall not his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall upon you your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes your defences are defences of clay. hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on me what will. wherefore should i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand behold he will slay me i have no hope nevertheless i will maintain my ways before him. this also shall be my salvation that a godless man shall not come before him. hear diligently my speech and let my declaration be in your ears. behold now i have set my cause in order i know that i am righteous. who is he that will contend with me for then would i hold my peace and give up the ghost.  only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from thy face withdraw thy hand far from me and let not thy terror make me afraid. then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer thou me. how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my transgression and my sin. wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy wilt thou harass a driven leaf and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and markest all my paths thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet though i am like a rotten thing that consumeth like a garment that is motheaten. man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. and dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one.  seeing his days are determined the number of his months is with thee and thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass look away from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as a hireling his day. for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and put forth boughs like a plant. but man dieth and is laid low yea man giveth up the ghost and where is he [as] the waters fail from the sea and the river wasteth and drieth up so man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be roused out of their sleep. oh that thou wouldest hide me in sheol that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live [again] all the days of my warfare would i wait till my release should come. thou wouldest call and i would answer thee thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.  but now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my sin my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou fastenest up mine iniquity. but the mountain falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of its place the waters wear the stones the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth so thou destroyest the hope of man. thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him away. his sons come to honor and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them. but his flesh upon him hath pain and his soul within him mourneth. then answered eliphaz the temanite and said should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge and fill himself with the east wind should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he can do no good yea thou doest away with fear and hinderest devotion before god. for thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips testify against thee.  art thou the first man that was born or wast thou brought forth before the hills hast thou heard the secret counsel of god and dost thou limit wisdom to thyself what knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which is not in us with us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men much elder than thy father. are the consolations of god too small for thee even the word that is gentle toward thee why doth thy heart carry thee away and why do thine eyes flash that against god thou turnest thy spirit and lettest words go out of thy mouth what is man that he should be clean and he that is born of a woman that he should be righteous behold he putteth no trust in his holy ones yea the heavens are not clean in his sight how much less one that is abominable and corrupt a man that drinketh iniquity like water i will show thee hear thou me and that which i have seen i will declare which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it unto whom alone the land was given and no stranger passed among them  the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. a sound of terrors is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the sword. he wandereth abroad for bread [saying] where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. distress and anguish make him afraid they prevail against him as a king ready to the battle. because he hath stretched out his hand against god and behaveth himself proudly against the almighty he runneth upon him with a [stiff] neck with the thick bosses of his bucklers because he hath covered his face with his fatness and gathered fat upon his loins and he hath dwelt in desolate cities in houses which no man inhabited which were ready to become heaps he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth. he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of [gods] mouth shall he go away.  let him not trust in vanity deceiving himself for vanity shall be his recompense. it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be green. he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olivetree. for the company of the godless shall be barren and fire shall consume the tents of bribery. they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity and their heart prepareth deceit. then job answered and said i have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye all. shall vain words have an end or what provoketh thee that thou answerest i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my souls stead i could join words together against you and shake my head at you. [but] i would strengthen you with my mouth and the solace of my lips would assuage [your grief]. though i speak my grief is not assuaged and though i forbear what am i eased but now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my company. and thou hast laid fast hold on me [which] is a witness [against me] and my leanness riseth up against me it testifieth to my face.  he hath torn me in his wrath and persecuted me he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they gather themselves together against me. god delivereth me to the ungodly and casteth me into the hands of the wicked. i was at ease and he brake me asunder yea he hath taken me by the neck and dashed me to pieces he hath also set me up for his mark. his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground. he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant. i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my horn in the dust. my face is red with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death although there is no violence in my hands and my prayer is pure. o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no [resting] place. even now behold my witness is in heaven and he that voucheth for me is on high. my friends scoff at me [but] mine eye poureth out tears unto god  that he would maintain the right of a man with god and of a son of man with his neighbor for when a few years are come i shall go the way whence i shall not return. my spirit is consumed my days are extinct the grave is [ready] for me. surely there are mockers with me and mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation. give now a pledge be surety for me with thyself who is there that will strike hands with me for thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt [them]. he that denounceth his friends for a prey even the eyes of his children shall fail. but he hath made me a byword of the people and they spit in my face. mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow. upright men shall be astonished at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless. yet shall the righteous hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger. but as for you all come on now again and i shall not find a wise man among you. my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart.  they change the night into day the light [say they] is near unto the darkness. if i look for sheol as my house if i have spread my couch in the darkness if i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm [thou art] my mother and my sister where then is my hope and as for my hope who shall see it it shall go down to the bars of sheol when once there is rest in the dust. then answered bildad the shuhite and said how long will ye hunt for words consider and afterwards we will speak. wherefore are we counted as beasts [and] are become unclean in your sight thou that tearest thyself in thine anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee or shall the rock be removed out of its place yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine. the light shall be dark in his tent and his lamp above him shall be put out. the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down. for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon the toils. a gin shall take [him] by the heel [and] a snare shall lay hold on him.  a noose is hid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the way. terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels. his strength shall be hungerbitten and calamity shall be ready at his side. the members of his body shall be devoured [yea] the firstborn of death shall devour his members. he shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth and he shall be brought to the king of terrors. there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off. his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street. he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world. he shall have neither son nor sons son among his people nor any remaining where he sojourned. they that come after shall be astonished at his day as they that went before were affrighted. surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous and this is the place of him that knoweth not god. then job answered and said  how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words these ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me. and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself. if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach know now that god hath subverted me [in my cause] and hath compassed me with his net. behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry for help but there is no justice. he hath walled up my way that i cannot pass and hath set darkness in my paths. he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head. he hath broken me down on every side and i am gone and my hope hath he plucked up like a tree. he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as [one of] his adversaries. his troops come on together and cast up their way against me and encamp round about my tent. he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me. my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me.  they that dwell in my house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight. i call unto my servant and he giveth me no answer [though] i entreat him with my mouth. my breath is strange to my wife and my supplication to the children of mine own mother. even young children despise me if i arise they speak against me. all my familiar friends abhor me and they whom i loved are turned against me. my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth. have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god hath touched me. why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were inscribed in a book that with an iron pen and lead they were graven in the rock for ever but as for me i know that my redeemer liveth and at last he will stand up upon the earth and after my skin [even] this [body] is destroyed then without my flesh shall i see god whom i even i shall see on my side and mine eyes shall behold and not as a stranger. my heart is consumed within me.  if ye say how we will persecute him and that the root of the matter is found in me be ye afraid of the sword for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment. then answered zophar the naamathite and said therefore do my thoughts give answer to me even by reason of my haste that is in me. i have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame and the spirit of my understanding answereth me. knowest thou [not] this of old time since man was placed upon earth that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the godless but for a moment though his height mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they that have seen him shall say where is he he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. the eye which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him. his children shall seek the favor of the poor and his hands shall give back his wealth. his bones are full of his youth but it shall lie down with him in the dust.  though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue though he spare it and will not let it go but keep it still within his mouth yet his food in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within him. he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god will cast them out of his belly. he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay him. he shall not look upon the rivers the flowing streams of honey and butter. that which he labored for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to the substance that he hath gotten he shall not rejoice. for he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor he hath violently taken away a house and he shall not build it up.  because he knew no quietness within him he shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth. there was nothing left that he devoured not therefore his prosperity shall not endure. in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. when he is about to fill his belly [god] will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him and will rain it upon him while he is eating.  he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of brass shall strike him through. he draweth it forth and it cometh out of his body yea the glittering point cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him. all darkness is laid up for his treasures a fire not blown [by man] shall devour him it shall consume that which is left in his tent. the heavens shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him. the increase of his house shall depart [his goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath. this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage appointed unto him by god. then job answered and said hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations.  suffer me and i also will speak and after that i have spoken mock on. as for me is my complaint to man and why should i not be impatient mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth. even when i remember i am troubled and horror taketh hold on my flesh. wherefore do the wicked live become old yea wax mighty in power their seed is established with them in their sight and their offspring before their eyes.  their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them. their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf. they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance. they sing to the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. they spend their days in prosperity and in a moment they go down to sheol. and they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him lo their prosperity is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me. how oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out that their calamity cometh upon them that [god] distributeth sorrows in his anger  that they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away [ye say] god layeth up his iniquity for his children. let him recompense it unto himself that he may know it let his own eyes see his destruction and let him drink of the wrath of the almighty.  for what careth he for his house after him when the number of his months is cut off shall any teach god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet his pails are full of milk and the marrow of his bones is moistened. and another dieth in bitterness of soul and never tasteth of good. they lie down alike in the dust and the worm covereth them. behold i know your thoughts and the devices wherewith ye would wrong me. for ye say where is the house of the prince and where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt have ye not asked wayfaring men and do ye not know their evidences that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity that they are led forth to the day of wrath who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done yet shall he be borne to the grave and men shall keep watch over the tomb. the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and all men shall draw after him as there were innumerable before him. how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth [only] falsehood  then answered eliphaz the temanite and said can a man be profitable unto god surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself. is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect is it for thy fear [of him] that he reproveth thee that he entereth with thee into judgment is not thy wickedness great neither is there any end to thine iniquities. for thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing. thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honorable man he dwelt in it. thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee or darkness so that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover thee. is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are and thou sayest what doth god know can he judge through the thick darkness  thick clouds are a covering to him so that he seeth not and he walketh on the vault of heaven. wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden who were snatched away before their time whose foundation was poured out as a stream who said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for us yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn [saying] surely they that did rise up against us are cut off and the remnant of them the fire hath consumed. acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee. receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thy heart. if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents. and lay thou [thy] treasure in the dust and [the gold of] ophir among the stones of the brooks and the almighty will be thy treasure and precious silver unto thee.  for then shalt thou delight thyself in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god. thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he will hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vows. thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and light shall shine upon thy ways. when they cast [thee] down thou shalt say [there is] lifting up and the humble person he will save. he will deliver [even] him that is not innocent yea he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands. then job answered and said even today is my complaint rebellious my stroke is heavier than my groaning. oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat i would set my cause in order before him and fill my mouth with arguments. i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me. would he contend with me in the greatness of his power nay but he would give heed unto me. there the upright might reason with him so should i be delivered for ever from my judge.  behold i go forward but he is not [there] and backward but i cannot perceive him on the left hand when he doth work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot see him. but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold. my foot hath held fast to his steps his way have i kept and turned not aside. i have not gone back from the commandment of his lips i have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. but he is in one [mind] and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth. for he performeth that which is appointed for me and many such things are with him. therefore am i terrified at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him. for god hath made my heart faint and the almighty hath terrified me because i was not cut off before the darkness neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face. why are times not laid up by the almighty and why do not they that know him see his days there are that remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed them.  they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows ox for a pledge. they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth all hide themselves. behold as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work seeking diligently for food the wilderness [yieldeth] them bread for their children. they cut their provender in the field and they glean the vintage of the wicked. they lie all night naked without clothing and have no covering in the cold. they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. there are that pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor [so that] they go about naked without clothing and being hungry they carry the sheaves. they make oil within the walls of these men they tread [their] winepresses and suffer thirst. from out of the populous city men groan and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet god regardeth not the folly. these are of them that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof. the murderer riseth with the light he killeth the poor and needy and in the night he is as a thief.  the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying no eye shall see me and he disguiseth his face. in the dark they dig through houses they shut themselves up in the day time they know not the light. for the morning is to all of them as thick darkness for they know the terrors of the thick darkness. swiftly they [pass away] upon the face of the waters their portion is cursed in the earth they turn not into the way of the vineyards. drought and heat consume the snow waters [so doth] sheol [those that] have sinned. the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree. he devoureth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow. yet [god] preserveth the mighty by his power he riseth up that hath no assurance of life. [god] giveth them to be in security and they rest thereon and his eyes are upon their ways. they are exalted yet a little while and they are gone yea they are brought low they are taken out of the way as all others and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.  and if it be not so now who will prove me a liar and make my speech nothing worth then answered bildad the shuhite and said dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places. is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise how then can man be just with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman behold even the moon hath no brightness and the stars are not pure in his sight how much less man that is a worm and the son of man that is a worm then job answered and said how hast thou helped him that is without power how hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and plentifully declared sound knowledge to whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came forth from thee they that are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof. sheol is naked before [god] and abaddon hath no covering. he stretcheth out the north over empty space and hangeth the earth upon nothing.  he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them. he incloseth the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it. he hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters unto the confines of light and darkness. the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke. he stirreth up the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through rahab. by his spirit the heavens are garnished his hand hath pierced the swift serpent. lo these are but the outskirts of his ways and how small a whisper do we hear of him but the thunder of his power who can understand and job again took up his parable and said as god liveth who hath taken away my right and the almighty who hath vexed my soul for my life is yet whole in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness neither shall my tongue utter deceit. far be it from me that i should justify you till i die i will not put away mine integrity from me. my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach [me] so long as i live.  let mine enemy be as the wicked and let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous. for what is the hope of the godless though he get him gain when god taketh away his soul will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the almighty and call upon god at all times i will teach you concerning the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal. behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye become altogether vain this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they receive from the almighty if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall make no lamentation. though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver. he buildeth his house as the moth and as a booth which the keeper maketh. he lieth down rich but he shall not be gathered [to his fathers] he openeth his eyes and he is not.  terrors overtake him like waters a tempest stealeth him away in the night. the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and it sweepeth him out of his place. for [god] shall hurl at him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand. men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place. surely there is a mine for silver and a place for gold which they refine. iron is taken out of the earth and copper is molten out of the stone. [man] setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness. he breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn they are forgotten of the foot they hang afar from men they swing to and fro. as for the earth out of it cometh bread and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. the stones thereof are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold. that path no bird of prey knoweth neither hath the falcons eye seen it the proud beasts have not trodden it nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby. he putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock he overturneth the mountains by the roots.  he cutteth out channels among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thing. he bindeth the streams that they trickle not and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living. the deep saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not with me. it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire. gold and glass cannot equal it neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal yea the price of wisdom is above rubies. the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold. whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the birds of the heavens. destruction and death say we have heard a rumor thereof with our ears. god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof.  for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven to make a weight for the wind yea he meteth out the waters by measure. when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder then did he see it and declare it he established it yea and searched it out. and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding. and job again took up his parable and said oh that i were as in the months of old as in the days when god watched over me when his lamp shined upon my head and by his light i walked through darkness as i was in the ripeness of my days when the friendship of god was upon my tent when the almighty was yet with me and my children were about me when my steps were washed with butter and the rock poured me out streams of oil when i went forth to the gate unto the city when i prepared my seat in the street the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged rose up and stood the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth  the voice of the nobles was hushed and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. for when the ear heard [me] then it blessed me and when the eye saw [me] it gave witness unto me because i delivered the poor that cried the fatherless also that had none to help him. the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy. i put on righteousness and it clothed me my justice was as a robe and a diadem. i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame. i was a father to the needy and the cause of him that i knew not i searched out. and i brake the jaws of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth. then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my days as the sand my root is spread out to the waters and the dew lieth all night upon my branch my glory is fresh in me and my bow is renewed in my hand. unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence for my counsel. after my words they spake not again and my speech distilled upon them. and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.  i smiled on them when they had no confidence and the light of my countenance they cast not down. i chose out their way and sat [as] chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mourners. but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. yea the strength of their hands whereto should it profit me men in whom ripe age is perished. they are gaunt with want and famine they gnaw the dry ground in the gloom of wasteness and desolation. they pluck salt wort by the bushes and the roots of the broom are their food. they are driven forth from the midst [of men] they cry after them as after a thief so that they dwell in frightful valleys in holes of the earth and of the rocks. among the bushes they bray under the nettles they are gathered together. [they are] children of fools yea children of base men they were scourged out of the land. and now i am become their song yea i am a byword unto them. they abhor me they stand aloof from me and spare not to spit in my face.  for he hath loosed his cord and afflicted me and they have cast off the bridle before me. upon my right hand rise the rabble they thrust aside my feet and they cast up against me their ways of destruction. they mar my path they set forward my calamity [even] men that have no helper. as through a wide breach they come in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves [upon me]. terrors are turned upon me they chase mine honor as the wind and my welfare is passed away as a cloud. and now my soul is poured out within me days of affliction have taken hold upon me. in the night season my bones are pierced in me and the [pains] that gnaw me take no rest. by [gods] great force is my garment disfigured it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and ashes. i cry unto thee and thou dost not answer me i stand up and thou gazest at me. thou art turned to be cruel to me with the might of thy hand thou persecutest me. thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride [upon it] and thou dissolvest me in the storm.  for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living. howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall or in his calamity therefore cry for help did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the needy when i looked for good then evil came and when i waited for light there came darkness.  my heart is troubled and resteth not days of affliction are come upon me. i go mourning without the sun i stand up in the assembly and cry for help. i am a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches. my skin is black [and falleth] from me and my bones are burned with heat. therefore is my harp [turned] to mourning and my pipe into the voice of them that weep. i made a covenant with mine eyes how then should i look upon a virgin for what is the portion from god above and the heritage from the almighty on high is it not calamity to the unrighteous and disaster to the workers of iniquity doth not he see my ways and number all my steps if i have walked with falsehood and my foot hath hasted to deceit  let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if my step hath turned out of the way and my heart walked after mine eyes and if any spot hath cleaved to my hands then let me sow and let another eat yea let the produce of my field be rooted out. if my heart hath been enticed unto a woman and i have laid wait at my neighbors door  then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her. for that were a heinous crime yea it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges for it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction and would root out all mine increase. if i have despised the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb if i have withheld the poor from [their] desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof  nay from my youth he grew up with me as with a father and her have i guided from my mothers womb if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or that the needy had no covering if his loins have not blessed me and if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because i saw my help in the gate then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone. for calamity from god is a terror to me and by reason of his majesty i can do nothing.  if i have made gold my hope and have said to the fine gold [thou art] my confidence if i have rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my hand had gotten much if i have beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness and my heart hath been secretly enticed and my mouth hath kissed my hand this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges for i should have denied the god that is above. if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him yea i have not suffered by mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse  if the men of my tent have not said who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat the sojourner hath not lodged in the street but i have opened my doors to the traveller if like adam i have covered my transgressions by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom because i feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that i kept silence and went not out of the door oh that i had one to hear me lo here is my signature let the almighty answer me and [that i had] the indictment which mine adversary hath written surely i would carry it upon my shoulder i would bind it unto me as a crown i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near unto him. if my land crieth out against me and the furrows thereof weep together if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley. the words of job are ended. so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes.  then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the family of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god. also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job. now elihu had waited to speak unto job because they were elder than he. and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men his wrath was kindled. and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i held back and durst not show you mine opinion. i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom. but there is a spirit in man and the breath of the almighty giveth them understanding. it is not the great that are wise nor the aged that understand justice. therefore i said hearken to me i also will show mine opinion. behold i waited for your words i listened for your reasonings whilst ye searched out what to say. yea i attended unto you and behold there was none that convinced job or that answered his words among you.  beware lest ye say we have found wisdom god may vanquish him not man for he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches. they are amazed they answer no more they have not a word to say. and shall i wait because they speak not because they stand still and answer no more i also will answer my part i also will show mine opinion. for i am full of words the spirit within me constraineth me. behold my breast is as wine which hath no vent like new wineskins it is ready to burst. i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer. let me not i pray you respect any mans person neither will i give flattering titles unto any man. for i know not to give flattering titles [else] would my maker soon take me away. howbeit job i pray thee hear my speech and hearken to all my words. behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. my words [shall utter] the uprightness of my heart and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty giveth me life.  if thou canst answer thou me set [thy words] in order before me stand forth. behold i am toward god even as thou art i also am formed out of the clay. behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. surely thou hast spoken in my hearing and i have heard the voice of [thy] words [saying] i am clean without transgression i am innocent neither is there iniquity in me behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his enemy he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my paths. behold i will answer thee in this thou art not just for god is greater than man. why dost thou strive against him for that he giveth not account of any of his matters for god speaketh once yea twice [though man] regardeth it not. in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man [from his] purpose and hide pride from man he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword.  he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty food. his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out. yea his soul draweth near unto the pit and his life to the destroyers. if there be with him an angel an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man what is right for him then [god] is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom. his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he returneth to the days of his youth. he prayeth unto god and he is favorable unto him so that he seeth his face with joy and he restoreth unto man his righteousness. he singeth before men and saith i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not he hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit and my life shall behold the light. lo all these things doth god work twice [yea] thrice with a man to bring back his soul from the pit that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.  mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak. if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee. if not hearken thou unto me hold thy peace and i will teach thee wisdom. moreover elihu answered and said hear my words ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge. for the ear trieth words as the palate tasteth food. let us choose for us that which is right let us know among ourselves what is good. for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my right notwithstanding my right i am [accounted] a liar my wound is incurable [though i am] without transgression. what man is like job who drinketh up scoffing like water who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked men for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god. therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity.  for the work of a man will he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways. yea of a surety god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert justice. who gave him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world if he set his heart upon himself [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust. if now [thou hast] understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words. shall even one that hateth justice govern and wilt thou condemn him that is righteous [and] mighty [him] that saith to a king [thou art] vile [or] to nobles [ye are] wicked that respecteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands. in a moment they die even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away and the mighty are taken away without hand. for his eyes are upon the ways of a man and he seeth all his goings. there is no darkness nor thick gloom where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.  for he needeth not further to consider a man that he should go before god in judgment. he breaketh in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding out and setteth others in their stead. therefore he taketh knowledge of their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed. he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others because they turned aside from following him and would not have regard in any of his ways so that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heard the cry of the afflicted. when he giveth quietness who then can condemn and when he hideth his face who then can behold him alike whether [it be done] unto a nation or unto a man that the godless man reign not that there be none to ensnare the people. for hath any said unto god i have borne [chastisement] i will not offend [any more] that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do it no more shall his recompense be as thou wilt that thou refusest it for thou must choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest.  men of understanding will say unto me yea every wise man that heareth me job speaketh without knowledge and his words are without wisdom. would that job were tried unto the end because of his answering like wicked men. for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against god. moreover elihu answered and said thinkest thou this to be [thy] right [or] sayest thou my righteousness is more than gods that thou sayest what advantage will it be unto thee [and] what profit shall i have more than if i had sinned i will answer thee and thy companions with thee. look unto the heavens and see and behold the skies which are higher than thou. if thou hast sinned what effectest thou against him and if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thy hand thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou art and thy righteousness [may profit] a son of man. by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.  but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men. surely god will not hear an empty [cry] neither will the almighty regard it. how much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not the cause is before him and thou waitest for him but now because he hath not visited in his anger neither doth he greatly regard arrogance therefore doth job open his mouth in vanity he multiplieth words without knowledge. elihu also proceeded and said suffer me a little and i will show thee for i have yet somewhat to say on gods behalf. i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker. for truly my words are not false one that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength of understanding. he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth to the afflicted [their] right.  he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings upon the throne he setteth them for ever and they are exalted. and if they be bound in fetters and be taken in the cords of afflictions then he showeth them their work and their transgressions that they have behaved themselves proudly. he openeth also their ear to instruction and commandeth that they return from iniquity. if they hearken and serve [him] they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures. but if they hearken not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge. but they that are godless in heart lay up anger they cry not for help when he bindeth them. they die in youth and their life [perisheth] among the unclean. he delivereth the afflicted by their affliction and openeth their ear in oppression. yea he would have allured thee out of distress into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness. but thou art full of the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold [on thee].  for let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. will thy cry avail [that thou be] not in distress or all the forces of [thy] strength desire not the night when peoples are cut off in their place. take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. behold god doeth loftily in his power who is a teacher like unto him who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought unrighteousness remember that thou magnify his work whereof men have sung. all men have looked thereon man beholdeth it afar off. behold god is great and we know him not the number of his years is unsearchable. for he draweth up the drops of water which distil in rain from his vapor which the skies pour down and drop upon man abundantly. yea can any understand the spreadings of the clouds the thunderings of his pavilion behold he spreadeth his light around him and he covereth the bottom of the sea. for by these he judgeth the peoples he giveth food in abundance.  he covereth his hands with the lightning and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. the noise thereof telleth concerning him the cattle also concerning [the storm] that cometh up. yea at this my heart trembleth and is moved out of its place. hear oh hear the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. he sendeth it forth under the whole heaven and his lightening unto the ends of the earth. after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his majesty and he restraineth not [the lightnings] when his voice is heard. god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend. for he saith to the snow fall thou on the earth likewise to the shower of rain and to the showers of his mighty rain. he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men whom he hath made may know [it]. then the beasts go into coverts and remain in their dens. out of the chamber [of the south] cometh the storm and cold out of the north. by the breath of god ice is given and the breadth of the waters is straitened. yea he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning  and it is turned round about by his guidance that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world whether it be for correction or for his land or for lovingkindness that he cause it to come. hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god. dost thou know how god layeth [his charge] upon them and causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge how thy garments are warm when the earth is still by reason of the south [wind] canst thou with him spread out the sky which is strong as a molten mirror teach us what we shall say unto him [for] we cannot set [our speech] in order by reason of darkness. shall it be told him that i would speak or should a man wish that he were swallowed up and now men see not the light which is bright in the skies but the wind passeth and cleareth them. out of the north cometh golden splendor god hath upon him terrible majesty.  [touching] the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict. men do therefore fear him he regardeth not any that are wise of heart. then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me. where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding. who determined the measures thereof if thou knowest or who stretched the line upon it whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy or [who] shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth [as if] it had issued out of the womb when i made clouds the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it and marked out for it my bound and set bars and doors  and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy days [began] [and] caused the dayspring to know its place that it might take hold of the ends of the earth and the wicked be shaken out of it it is changed as clay under the seal and [all things] stand forth as a garment and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm is broken. hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep have the gates of death been revealed unto thee or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth declare if thou knowest it all. where is the way to the dwelling of light and as for darkness where is the place thereof that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof [doubtless] thou knowest for thou wast then born and the number of thy days is great  hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war  by what way is the light parted or the east wind scattered upon the earth who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood or the way for the lightning of the thunder to cause it to rain on a land where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man to satisfy the waste and desolate [ground] and to cause the tender grass to spring forth hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it the waters hide themselves [and become] like stone and the face of the deep is frozen. canst thou bind the cluster of the pleiades or loose the bands of orion canst thou lead forth the mazzaroth in their season or canst thou guide the bear with her train knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth  canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee canst thou send forth lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the mind who can number the clouds by wisdom or who can pour out the bottles of heaven  when the dust runneth into a mass and the clods cleave fast together canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness or satisfy the appetite of the young lions when they couch in their dens [and] abide in the covert to lie in wait who provideth for the raven his prey when his young ones cry unto god [and] wander for lack of food knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth [or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve canst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forth they bow themselves they bring forth their young they cast out their pains. their young ones become strong they grow up in the open field they go forth and return not again.  who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass whose home i have made the wilderness and the salt land his dwellingplace he scorneth the tumult of the city neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thing. will the wildox be content to serve thee or will he abide by thy crib  canst thou bind the wildox with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after thee wilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave to him thy labor wilt thou confide in him that he will bring home thy seed and gather [the grain] of thy threshing floor the wings of the ostrich wave proudly [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love for she leaveth her eggs on the earth and warmeth them in the dust and forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them. she dealeth hardly with her young ones as if they were not hers though her labor be in vain [she is] without fear because god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding.  what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his rider. hast thou given the horse [his] might hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane hast thou made him to leap as a locust the glory of his snorting is terrible. he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth out to meet the armed men. he mocketh at fear and is not dismayed neither turneth he back from the sword. the quiver rattleth against him the flashing spear and the javelin. he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet. as oft as the trumpet [soundeth] he saith aha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting. is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth and stretcheth her wings toward the south is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up and maketh her nest on high on the cliff she dwelleth and maketh her home upon the point of the cliff and the stronghold. from thence she spieth out the prey her eyes behold it afar off.  her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she. moreover jehovah answered job and said shall he that cavilleth contend with the almighty he that argueth with god let him answer it. then job answered jehovah and said behold i am of small account what shall i answer thee i lay my hand upon my mouth. once have i spoken and i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further. then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind and said gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me. wilt thou even annul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be justified or hast thou an arm like god and canst thou thunder with a voice like him deck thyself now with excellency and dignity and array thyself with honor and majesty. pour forth the overflowings of thine anger and look upon every one that is proud and abase him. look on every one that is proud [and] bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand. hide them in the dust together bind their faces in the hidden [place].  then will i also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee. behold now behemoth which i made as well as thee he eateth grass as an ox. lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the muscles of his belly. he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are knit together. his bones are [as] tubes of brass his limbs are like bars of iron. he is the chief of the ways of god he [only] that made him giveth him his sword. surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field do play. he lieth under the lotustrees in the covert of the reed and the fen. the lotustrees cover him with their shade the willows of the brook compass him about. behold if a river overflow he trembleth not he is confident though a jordan swell even to his mouth. shall any take him when he is on the watch or pierce through his nose with a snare canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord canst thou put a rope into his nose or pierce his jaw through with a hook will he make many supplications unto thee or will he speak soft words unto thee  will he make a covenant with thee that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him will they part him among the merchants canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fishspears lay thy hand upon him remember the battle and do so no more. behold the hope of him is in vain will not one be cast down even at the sight of him none is so fierce that he dare stir him up who then is he that can stand before me who hath first given unto me that i should repay him [whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine. i will not keep silence concerning his limbs nor his mighty strength nor his goodly frame. who can strip off his outer garment who shall come within his jaws who can open the doors of his face round about his teeth is terror. [his] strong scales are [his] pride shut up together [as with] a close seal. one is so near to another that no air can come between them. they are joined one to another they stick together so that they cannot be sundered.  his sneezings flash forth light and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. out of his mouth go burning torches and sparks of fire leap forth. out of his nostrils a smoke goeth as of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes. his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth forth from his mouth. in his neck abideth strength and terror danceth before him. the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm upon him they cannot be moved. his heart is as firm as a stone yea firm as the nether millstone. when he raiseth himself up the mighty are afraid by reason of consternation they are beside themselves. if one lay at him with the sword it cannot avail nor the spear the dart nor the pointed shaft. he counteth iron as straw [and] brass as rotten wood. the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble. clubs are counted as stubble he laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. his underparts are [like] sharp potsherds he spreadeth [as it were] a threshingwain upon the mire. he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.  he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary. upon earth there is not his like that is made without fear. he beholdeth everything that is high he is king over all the sons of pride. then job answered jehovah and said i know that thou canst do all things and that no purpose of thine can be restrained. who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that which i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not. hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me. i had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee wherefore i abhor [myself] and repent in dust and ashes. and it was so that after jehovah had spoken these words unto job jehovah said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath.  now therefore take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burntoffering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept that i deal not with you after your folly for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath. so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did according as jehovah commanded them and jehovah accepted job. and jehovah turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends and jehovah gave job twice as much as he had before. then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him concerning all the evil that jehovah had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one a ring of gold. so jehovah blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning and he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses.  he had also seven sons and three daughters. and he called the name of the first jemimah and the name of the second keziah and the name of the third keren happuch. and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. and after this job lived a hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons [even] four generations. so job died being old and full of days. blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of jehovah and on his law doth he meditate day and night. and he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water that bringeth forth its fruit in its season whose leaf also doth not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. the wicked are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. for jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked shall perish.  why do the nations rage and the peoples meditate a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against jehovah and against his anointed [saying] let us break their bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us. he that sitteth in the heavens will laugh the lord will have them in derision. then will he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure yet i have set my king upon my holy hill of zion. i will tell of the decree jehovah said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee. ask of me and i will give [thee] the nations for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel. now therefore be wise o ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth. serve jehovah with fear and rejoice with trembling. kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish in the way for his wrath will soon be kindled. blessed are all they that take refuge in him.  a psalm of david when he fled from absalom his son. jehovah how are mine adversaries increased many are they that rise up against me. many there are that say of my soul there is no help for him in god. selah but thou o jehovah art a shield about me my glory and the lifter up of my head. i cry unto jehovah with my voice and he answereth me out of his holy hill. selah i laid me down and slept i awaked for jehovah sustaineth me. i will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people that have set themselves against me round about. arise o jehovah save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. salvation belongeth unto jehovah thy blessing be upon thy people. selah for the chief musician on stringed instruments. a psalm of david. answer me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast set me at large [when i was] in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.  o ye sons of men how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor [how long] will ye love vanity and seek after falsehood selah but know that jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly jehovah will hear when i call unto him. stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still. selah offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in jehovah. many there are that say who will show us [any] good jehovah lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. thou hast put gladness in my heart more than [they have] when their grain and their new wine are increased. in peace will i both lay me down and sleep for thou jehovah alone makest me dwell in safety. for the chief musician with the nehiloth. a psalm of david. give ear to my words o jehovah consider my meditation. hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee do i pray. o jehovah in the morning shalt thou hear my voice in the morning will i order [my prayer] unto thee and will keep watch. for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness evil shall not sojourn with thee.  the arrogant shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity. thou wilt destroy them that speak lies jehovah abhorreth the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. but as for me in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will i come into thy house in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple. lead me o jehovah in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my face. for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue. hold them guilty o god let them fall by their own counsels thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against thee. but let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. for thou wilt bless the righteous o jehovah thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield. for the chief musician on stringed instruments set to the sheminith. a psalm of david. o jehovah rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  have mercy upon me o jehovah for i am withered away o jehovah heal me for my bones are troubled. my soul also is sore troubled and thou o jehovah how long return o jehovah deliver my soul save me for thy lovingkindness sake. for in death there is no remembrance of thee in sheol who shall give thee thanks i am weary with my groaning every night make i my bed to swim i water my couch with my tears. mine eye wasteth away because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping. jehovah hath heard my supplication jehovah will receive my prayer. all mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled they shall turn back they shall be put to shame suddenly. shiggaion of david which he sang unto jehova concerning the words of cush a benjamite. o jehovah my god in thee do i take refuge save me from all them that pursue me and deliver me lest they tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliver.  o jehovah my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea i have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it yea let him tread my life down to the earth and lay my glory in the dust. selah arise o jehovah in thine anger lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries and awake for me thou hast commanded judgment. and let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about and over them return thou on high. jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples judge me o jehovah according to my righteousness and to mine integrity that is in me. o let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish thou the righteous for the righteous god trieth the minds and hearts. my shield is with god who saveth the upright in heart. god is a righteous judge yea a god that hath indignation every day. if a man turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready.  he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he maketh his arrows fiery [shafts]. behold he travaileth with iniquity yea he hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood. he hath made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which he made. his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. i will give thanks unto jehovah according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of jehovah most high. for the chief musician set to the gittith. a psalm of david. o jehovah our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who hast set thy glory upon the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength because of thine adversaries that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou hast made him but little lower than god and crownest him with glory and honor.  thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yea and the

musician set to muthlabben. a psalm of david. i will give thanks unto jehovah with my whole heart i will show forth all thy marvellous works. i will be glad and exult in thee i will sing praise to thy name o thou most high. when mine enemies turn back they stumble and perish at thy presence. for thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou sittest in the throne judging righteously. thou hast rebuked the nations thou hast destroyed the wicked thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. the enemy are come to an end they are desolate for ever and the cities which thou hast overthrown the very remembrance of them is perished. but jehovah sitteth [as king] for ever he hath prepared his throne for judgment  and he will judge the world in righteousness he will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed a high tower in times of trouble and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou jehovah hast not forsaken

have mercy upon me o jehovah behold my affliction [which i suffer] of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death that i may show forth all thy praise. in the gates of the daughter of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation. the nations are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. jehovah hath made himself known he hath executed judgment the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. higgaion. selah the wicked shall be turned back unto sheol even all the nations that forget god. for the needy shall not alway be forgotten nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.  arise o jehovah let not man prevail let the nations be judged in thy sight. put them in fear o jehovah let the nations know themselves to be but men. selah why standest thou afar off o jehovah why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble  in the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived. for the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire and the covetous renounceth [yea] contemneth jehovah. the wicked in the pride of his countenance [saith] he will not require [it]. all his thoughts are there is no god. his ways are firm at all times thy judgments are far above out of his sight as for all his adversaries he puffeth at them. he saith in his heart i shall not be moved to all generations i shall not be in adversity. his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. he sitteth in the lurkingplaces of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the helpless.  he lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him in his net. he croucheth he boweth down and the helpless fall by his strong ones. he saith in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see it. arise o jehovah o god lift up thy hand forget not the poor.  wherefore doth the wicked contemn god and say in his heart thou wilt not require [it] thou hast seen [it] for thou beholdest mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand the helpless committeth [himself] unto thee thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. break thou the arm of the wicked and as for the evil man seek out his wickedness till thou find none. jehovah is king for ever and ever the nations are perished out of his land. jehovah thou hast heard the desire of the meek thou wilt prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hear to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.  for the chief musician.

[a psalm] of david. the fool hath said in his heart there is no god. they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good. jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek after god. they are all gone aside they are together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one. have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people [as] they eat bread and call not upon jehovah there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the righteous. ye put to shame the counsel of the poor because jehovah is his refuge. oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people then shall jacob rejoice [and] israel shall be glad. a psalm of david. jehovah who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh truth in his heart  he that slandereth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his friend nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a reprobate is despised but who honoreth them that fear jehovah he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not he that putteth not out his money to interest nor taketh reward against the innocent. he that doeth these things shall never be moved. michtam of david. preserve me o god for in thee do i take refuge. [o my soul] thou hast said unto jehovah thou art my lord i have no good beyond thee. as for the saints that are in the earth they are the excellent in whom is all my delight. their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another [god] their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take their names upon my lips. jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot. the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage. i will bless jehovah who hath given me counsel yea my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.  i have set jehovah always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved. therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall dwell in safety. for thou wilt not leave my soul to sheol neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. thou wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. a prayer of david. hear the right o jehovah attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips. let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes look upon equity. thou hast proved my heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried me and findest nothing i am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. as for the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the ways of the violent. my steps have held fast to thy paths my feet have not slipped. i have called upon thee for thou wilt answer me o god incline thine ear unto me [and] hear my speech.  show thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge [in thee ]from those that rise up [against them]. keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppress me my deadly enemies that compass me about. they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly. they have now compassed us in our steps they set their eyes to cast [us] down to the earth. he is like a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. arise o jehovah confront him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword from men by thy hand o jehovah from men of the world whose portion is in [this] life and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure they are satisfied with children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. as for me i shall behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with [beholding] thy form.  for the chief musician. [a psalm] of david the servant of jehovah who spake unto jehovah the words of this song in the day that jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul and he said i love thee o jehovah my strength. jehovah is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my rock in whom i will take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower. i will call upon jehovah who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies. the cords of death compassed me and the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. the cords of sheol were round about me the snares of death came upon me. in my distress i called upon jehovah and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry before him came into his ears. then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken because he was wroth. there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it. he bowed the heavens also and came down and thick darkness was under his feet.  and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he soared upon the wings of the wind. he made darkness his hidingplace his pavilion round about him darkness of waters thick clouds of the skies. at the brightness before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire. jehovah also thundered in the heavens and the most high uttered his voice hailstones and coals of fire. and he sent out his arrows and scattered them yea lightnings manifold and discomfited them. then the channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were laid bare at thy rebuke o jehovah at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. he sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters. he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too mighty for me. they came upon me in the day of my calamity but jehovah was my stay. he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me. jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  for i have kept the ways of jehovah and have not wickedly departed from my god. for all his ordinances were before me and i put not away his statutes from me. i was also perfect with him and i kept myself from mine iniquity. therefore hath jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. with the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful with the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward. for thou wilt save the afflicted people but the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down. for thou wilt light my lamp jehovah my god will lighten my darkness. for by thee i run upon a troop and by my god do i leap over a wall. as for god his way is perfect the word of jehovah is tried he is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. for who is god save jehovah and who is a rock besides our god the god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hinds [feet] and setteth me upon my high places.  he teacheth my hands to war so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great. thou hast enlarged my steps under me and my feet have not slipped. i will pursue mine enemies and overtake them neither will i turn again till they are consumed. i will smite them through so that they shall not be able to rise they shall fall under my feet. for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me that i might cut off them that hate me. they cried but there was none to save even unto jehovah but he answered them not. then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did cast them out as the mire of the streets. thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people thou hast made me the head of the nations a people whom i have not known shall serve me. as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.  the foreigners shall fade away and shall come trembling out of their close places. jehovah liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of my salvation even the god that executeth vengeance for me and subdueth peoples under me. he rescueth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me thou deliverest me from the violent man. therefore i will give thanks unto thee o jehovah among the nations and will sing praises unto thy name. great deliverance giveth he to his king and showeth lovingkindness to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth his handiwork. day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge. there is no speech nor language their voice is not heard. their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world. in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun  which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. his going forth is from the end of the heavens and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. the law of jehovah is perfect restoring the soul the testimony of jehovah is sure making wise the simple. the precepts of jehovah are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of jehovah is pure enlightening the eyes. the fear of jehovah is clean enduring for ever the ordinances of jehovah are true [and] righteous altogether. more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. moreover by them is thy servant warned in keeping them there is great reward. who can discern [his] errors clear thou me from hidden [faults]. keep back thy servant also from presumptuous [sins] let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be clear from great transgression.  let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o jehovah my rock and my redeemer. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of jacob set thee up on high send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of zion remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice selah grant thee thy hearts desire and fulfil all thy counsel. we will triumph in thy salvation and in the name of our god we will set up our banners jehovah fulfil all thy petitions. now know i that jehovah saveth his anointed he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. some [trust] in chariots and some in horses but we will make mention of the name of jehovah our god. they are bowed down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright. save jehovah let the king answer us when we call. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. the king shall joy in thy strength o jehovah and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips. selah  for thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. he asked life of thee thou gavest it him even length of days for ever and ever. his glory is great in thy salvation honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him. for thou makest him most blessed for ever thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. for the king trusteth in jehovah and through the lovingkindness of the most high he shall not be moved. thy hand will find out all thine enemies thy right hand will find out those that hate thee. thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them. their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men. for they intended evil against thee they conceived a device which they are not able to perform. for thou wilt make them turn their back thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face. be thou exalted o jehovah in thy strength so will we sing and praise thy power.  for the chief musician set to aijaleth hash shahar. a psalm of david. my god my god why hast thou forsaken me [why art thou so] far from helping me [and from] the words of my groaning o my god i cry in the daytime but thou answerest not and in the night season and am not silent. but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel. our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them. they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not put to shame. but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people. all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head [saying] commit [thyself] unto jehovah let him deliver him let him rescue him seeing he delighteth in him. but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me trust [when i was] upon my mothers breasts. i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god since my mother bare me. be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help. many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset me round.  they gape upon me with their mouth [as] a ravening and a roaring lion. i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted within me. my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. for dogs have compassed me a company of evildoers have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet. i may count all my bones they look and stare upon me. they part my garments among them and upon my vesture do they cast lots. but be not thou far off o jehovah o thou my succor haste thee to help me. deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog. save me from the lions mouth yea from the horns of the wild oxen thou hast answered me. i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the assembly will i praise thee. ye that fear jehovah praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and stand in awe of him all ye the seed of israel. for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard.  of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly i will pay my vows before them that fear him. the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise jehovah that seek after him let your heart live for ever. all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto jehovah and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. for the kingdom is jehovahs and he is the ruler over the nations. all the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him even he that cannot keep his soul alive.  a seed shall serve him it shall be told of the lord unto the [next] generation. they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done it. a psalm of david. jehovah is my shepherd i shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters. he restoreth my soul he guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his names sake. yea thou i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou hast anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over. surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of jehovah for ever. a psalm of david. the earth is jehovahs and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein. for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods. who shall ascend into the hill of jehovah and who shall stand in his holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood and hath not sworn deceitfully.  he shall receive a blessing from jehovah and righteousness from the god of his salvation. this is the generation of them that seek after him that seek thy face [even] jacob. selah lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory will come in. who is the king of glory jehovah strong and mighty jehovah mighty in battle. lift up your heads o ye gates yea lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory will come in.  who is this king of glory jehovah of hosts he is the king of glory. selah [a psalm] of david. unto thee o jehovah do i lift up my soul. o my god in thee have i trusted let me not be put to shame let not mine enemies triumph over me. yea none that wait for thee shall be put to shame they shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause. show me thy ways o jehovah teach me thy paths. guide me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation for thee do i wait all the day. remember o jehovah thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness for they have been ever of old. remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy lovingkindness remember thou me for thy goodness sake o jehovah.  good and upright is jehovah therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. the meek will he guide in justice and the meek will he teach his way. all the paths of jehovah are lovingkindness and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. for thy names sake o jehovah pardon mine iniquity for it is great.  what man is he that feareth jehovah him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose. his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the land. the friendship of jehovah is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant. mine eyes are ever toward jehovah for he will pluck my feet out of the net. turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted. the troubles of my heart are enlarged oh bring thou me out of my distresses. consider mine affliction and my travail and forgive all my sins. consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with cruel hatred. oh keep my soul and deliver me let me not be put to shame for i take refuge in thee. let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait for thee. redeem israel o god out all of his troubles.

[a psalm] of david. jehovah is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear jehovah is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh [even] mine adversaries and my foes they stumbled and fell. though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me even then will i be confident.  one thing have i asked of jehovah that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of jehovah all the days of my life to behold the beauty of jehovah and to inquire in his temple. for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion in the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me he will lift me up upon a rock. and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. and i will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto jehovah. hear o jehovah when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me. [when thou saidst] seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face jehovah will i seek. hide not thy face from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help cast me not off neither forsake me o god of my salvation. when my father and my mother forsake me then jehovah will take me up. teach me thy way o jehovah and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies. deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty.  [i had fainted] unless i had believed to see the goodness of jehovah in the land of the living. wait for jehovah be strong and let thy heart take courage yea wait thou for jehovah. [a psalm] of david. unto thee o jehovah will i call my rock be not thou deaf unto me lest if thou be silent unto me i become like them that go down into the pit. hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity that speak peace with their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts. give them according to their work and according to the wickedness of their doings give them after the operation of their hands render to them their desert. because they regard not the works of jehovah nor the operation of his hands he will break them down and not build them up. blessed be jehovah because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. jehovah is my strength and my shield my heart hath trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will i praise him.  jehovah is their strength and he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed. save thy people and bless thine inheritance be their shepherd also and bear them up for ever. a psalm of david. ascribe unto jehovah o ye sons of the mighty ascribe unto jehovah glory and strength. ascribe unto jehovah the glory due unto his name worship jehovah in holy array. the voice of jehovah is upon the waters the god of glory thundereth even jehovah upon many waters. the voice of jehovah is powerful the voice of jehovah is full of majesty. the voice of jehovah breaketh the cedars yea jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of lebanon. he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and sirion like a young wildox. the voice of jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire. the voice of jehovah shaketh the wilderness jehovah shaketh the wilderness of kadesh. the voice of jehovah maketh the hinds to calve and strippeth the forests bare and in his temple everything saith glory. jehovah sat [as king] at the flood yea jehovah sitteth as king for ever.  jehovah will give strength unto his people jehovah will bless his people with peace. a psalm a song at the dedication of the house. [a psalm] of david. i will extol thee o jehovah for thou hast raised me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. o jehovah my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me. o jehovah thou hast brought up my soul from sheol thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit. sing praise unto jehovah o ye saints of his and give thanks to his holy memorial [name]. for his anger is but for a moment his favor is for a lifetime weeping may tarry for the night but joy [cometh] in the morning. as for me i said in my prosperity i shall never be moved. thou jehovah of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face i was troubled. i cried to thee o jehovah and unto jehovah i made supplication what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth hear o jehovah and have mercy upon me jehovah be thou my helper.  thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that [my] glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent. o jehovah my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. in thee o jehovah do i take refuge let me never be put to shame deliver me in thy righteousness. bow down thine ear unto me deliver me speedily be thou to me a strong rock a house of defence to save me. for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy names sake lead me and guide me. pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my stronghold. into thy hand i commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me o jehovah thou god of truth. i hate them that regard lying vanities but i trust in jehovah. i will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness for thou hast seen my affliction thou hast known my soul in adversities and thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large place.  have mercy upon me o jehovah for i am in distress mine eye wasteth away with grief [yea] my soul and my body. for my life is spent with sorrow and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are wasted away. because of all mine adversaries i am become a reproach yea unto my neighbors exceedingly and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me. i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel. for i have heard the defaming of many terror on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life. but i trusted in thee o jehovah i said thou art my god. my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me. make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me in thy lovingkindness. let me not be put to shame o jehovah for i have called upon thee let the wicked be put to shame let them be silent in sheol. let the lying lips be dumb which speak against the righteous insolently with pride and contempt.  oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee before the sons of men in the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. blessed be jehovah for he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city. as for me i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee. oh love jehovah all ye his saints jehovah preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly. be strong and let your heart take courage all ye that hope in jehovah. [a psalm] of david. maschil. blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered. blessed is the man unto whom jehovah imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile. when i kept silence my bones wasted away through my groaning all the day long. for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture was changed [as] with the drought of summer. selah  i acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity did i not hide i said i will confess my transgressions unto jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. selah for this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him. thou art my hidingplace thou wilt preserve me from trouble thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. selah i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in [else] they will not come near unto thee. many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in jehovah lovingkindness shall compass him about. be glad in jehovah and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart. rejoice in jehovah o ye righteous praise is comely for the upright. give thanks unto jehovah with the harp sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.  sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise. for the word of jehovah is right and all his work is [done] in faithfulness. he loveth righteousness and justice the earth is full of the lovingkindness of jehovah. by the word of jehovah were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. he gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap he layeth up the deeps in storehouses. let all the earth fear jehovah let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast. jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought he maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. the counsel of jehovah standeth fast for ever the thoughts of his heart to all generations. blessed is the nation whose god is jehovah the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. jehovah looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men from the place of his habitation he looketh forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth he that fashioneth the hearts of them all that considereth all their works.  there is no king saved by the multitude of a host a mighty man is not delivered by great strength. a horse is a vain thing for safety neither doth he deliver any by his great power. behold the eye of jehovah is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his lovingkindness to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine. our soul hath waited for jehovah he is our help and our shield. for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name. let thy lovingkindness o jehovah be upon us according as we have hoped in thee. a psalm of david when he changed his behavior before abimelech who drove him away and he departed. i will bless jehovah at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth. my soul shall make her boast in jehovah the meek shall hear thereof and be glad. oh magnify jehovah with me and let us exalt his name together. i sought jehovah and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. they looked unto him and were radiant and their faces shall never be confounded.  this poor man cried and jehovah heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. the angel of jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them. oh taste and see that jehovah is good blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him. oh fear jehovah ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him. the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek jehovah shall not want any good thing. come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of jehovah. what man is he that desireth life and loveth [many] days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile. depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it. the eyes of jehovah are toward the righteous and his ears are [open] unto their cry. the face of jehovah is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. [the righteous] cried and jehovah heard and delivered them out of all their troubles. jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.  many are the afflictions of the righteous but jehovah delivereth him out of them all. he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken. evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned. [a psalm] of david. strive thou o jehovah with them that strive with me fight thou against them that fight against me. take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for my help. draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that pursue me say unto my soul i am thy salvation. let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt. let them be as chaff before the wind and the angel of jehovah driving [them] on. let their way be dark and slippery and the angel of jehovah pursuing them. for without cause have they hid for me their net [in] a pit without cause have they digged [a pit] for my soul. let destruction come upon him unawares and let his net that he hath hid catch himself with destruction let him fall therein.  and my soul shall be joyful in jehovah it shall rejoice in his salvation. all my bones shall say jehovah who is like unto thee who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him unrighteous witnesses rise up they ask me of things that i know not. they reward me evil for good [to] the bereaving of my soul. but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i afflicted my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. i behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother i bowed down mourning as one that bewaileth his mother. but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together the abjects gathered themselves together against me and i knew [it] not they did tear me and ceased not like the profane mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their teeth. lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lions. i will give thee thanks in the great assembly i will praise thee among much people.  let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land. yea they opened their mouth wide against me they said aha aha our eye hath seen it. thou hast seen it o jehovah keep not silence o lord be not far from me. stir up thyself and awake to the justice [due] unto me [even] unto my cause my god and my lord. judge me o jehovah my god according to thy righteousness and let them not rejoice over me. let them not say in their heart aha so would we have it let them not say we have swallowed him up. let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me. let them shout for joy and be glad that favor my righteous cause yea let them say continually jehovah be magnified who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. and my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness [and] of thy praise all the day long.  for the chief musician. [a psalm] of david the servant of jehovah. the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart there is no fear of god before his eyes. for he flattereth himself in his own eyes that his iniquity will not be found out and be hated. the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath ceased to be wise [and] to do good. he deviseth iniquity upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evil.  thy lovingkindness o jehovah is in the heavens thy faithfulness [reacheth] unto the skies. thy righteousness is like the mountains of god thy judgments are a great deep o jehovah thou preservest man and beast. how precious is thy lovingkindness o god and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see light. oh continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.  let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are thrust down and shall not be able to rise. [a psalm] of david. fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb. trust in jehovah and do good dwell in the land and feed on [his] faithfulness.  delight thyself also in jehovah and he will give thee the desires of thy heart. commit thy way unto jehovah trust also in him and he will bring it to pass. and he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light and thy justice as the noonday. rest in jehovah and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself [it tendeth] only to evildoing. for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait for jehovah they shall inherit the land. for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and he shall not be.  but the meek shall inherit the land and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. the lord will laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming. the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy to slay such as are upright in the way. their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken.  better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked. for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but jehovah upholdeth the righteous. jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect and their inheritance shall be for ever. they shall not be put to shame in the time of evil and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume in smoke shall they consume away. the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous dealeth graciously and giveth. for such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land and they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.  a mans goings are established of jehovah and he delighteth in his way. though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for jehovah upholdeth him with his hand. i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread. all the day long he dealeth graciously and lendeth and his seed is blessed. depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore. for jehovah loveth justice and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever. the mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom and his tongue speaketh justice. the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide. the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him. jehovah will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged. wait for jehovah and keep his way and he will exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it. i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.  but one passed by and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found. mark the perfect man and behold the upright for there is a [happy] end to the man of peace. as for transgressors they shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off. but the salvation of the righteous is of jehovah he is their stronghold in the time of trouble. and jehovah helpeth them and rescueth them he rescueth them from the wicked and saveth them because they have taken refuge in him. a psalm of david to bring to remembrance. o jehovah rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore. there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. for mine iniquities are gone over my head as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. my wounds are loathsome and corrupt because of my foolishness. i am pained and bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long.  for my loins are filled with burning and there is no soundness in my flesh. i am faint and sore bruised i have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart. lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee. my heart throbbeth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from me. my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague and my kinsmen stand afar off. they also that seek after my life lay snares [for me] and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and meditate deceits all the day long. but i as a deaf man hear not and i am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. yea i am as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs. for in thee o jehovah do i hope thou wilt answer o lord my god. for i said lest they rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me. for i am ready to fall and my sorrow is continually before me. for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin.  but mine enemies are lively [and] are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. they also that render evil for good are adversaries unto me because i follow the thing that is good. forsake me not o jehovah o my god be not far from me. make haste to help me o lord my salvation. for the chief musician jeduthun. a psalm of david. i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me. i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred. my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned [then] spake i with my tongue jehovah make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is let me know how frail i am. behold thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths and my lifetime is as nothing before thee surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. selah surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up [riches] and knoweth not who shall gather them. and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee.  deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish. i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it. remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thy hand. when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity. selah hear my prayer o jehovah and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee a sojourner as all my fathers were. oh spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. i waited patiently for jehovah and he inclined unto me and heard my cry. he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and he set my feet upon a rock and established my goings. and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in jehovah. blessed is the man that maketh jehovah his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies.  many o jehovah my god are the wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to usward they cannot be set in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered. sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in mine ears hast thou opened burntoffering and sinoffering hast thou not required. then said i lo i am come in the roll of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart. i have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly lo i will not refrain my lips o jehovah thou knowest. i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly. withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o jehovah let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have overtaken me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of my head and my heart hath failed me.  be pleased o jehovah to deliver me make haste to help me o jehovah. let them be put to shame and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor that delight in my hurt. let them be desolate by reason of their shame that say unto me aha aha. let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually jehovah be magnified. but i am poor and needy [yet] the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. blessed is he that considereth the poor jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil. jehovah will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing thou makest all his bed in his sickness. i said o jehovah have mercy upon me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee. mine enemies speak evil against me [saying] when will he die and his name perish  and if he come to see [me] he speaketh falsehood his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it. all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt. an evil disease [say they] cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted who did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me. but thou o jehovah have mercy upon me and raise me up that i may requite them. by this i know that thou delightest in me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever. blessed be jehovah the god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting. amen and amen. i for the chief musician. maschil of the sons of korah. as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god. my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my food day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god

o my soul and [why] art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him [for] the help of his countenance. o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore do i remember thee from the land of the jordan and the hermons from the hill mizar. deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. [yet] jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me [even] a prayer unto the god of my life. i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as with a sword in my bones mine adversaries reproach me while they continually say unto me where is thy god why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him [who is] the help of my countenance and my god.  judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. for thou art the god of my strength why hast thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy oh send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles. then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy and upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god. why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him [who is] the help of my countenance and my god. for the chief musician. [a psalm] of the sons of korah. maschil. we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the days of old. thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand but them thou didst plant thou didst afflict the peoples but them thou didst spread abroad.  for they gat not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou wast favorable unto them. thou art my king o god command deliverance for jacob. through thee will we push down our adversaries through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me. but thou hast saved us from our adversaries and hast put them to shame that hate us. in god have we made our boast all the day long and we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. selah but now thou hast cast [us] off and brought us to dishonor and goest not forth with our hosts. thou makest us to turn back from the adversary and they that hate us take spoil for themselves. thou hast made us like sheep [appointed] for food and hast scattered us among the nations. thou sellest thy people for nought and hast not increased [thy wealth] by their price. thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors a scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.  thou makest us a byword among the nations a shaking of the head among the peoples. all the day long is my dishonor before me and the shame of my face hath covered me for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and the avenger. all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way that thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death. if we have forgotten the name of our god or spread forth our hands to a strange god will not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast [us] not off for ever. wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression for our soul is bowed down to the dust our body cleaveth unto the earth. rise up for our help and redeem us for thy lovingkindness sake.  for the chief musician set to shoshannim.

and high rich and poor together. my mouth shall speak wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp. wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about  they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none [of them] can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him for the redemption of their life is costly and it faileth for ever that he should still live alway that he should not see corruption.  for he shall see it. wise men die the fool and the brutish alike perish and leave their wealth to others. their inward thought is [that] their houses [shall continue] for ever [and] their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names. but man [being] in honor abideth not he is like the beasts that perish. this their way is their folly yet after them men approve their sayings. selah they are appointed as a flock for sheol death shall be their shepherd and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall be for sheol to consume that there be no habitation for it. but god will redeem my soul from the power of sheol for he will receive me. selah be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased.  for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him. though while he lived he blessed his soul and men praise thee when thou doest well to thyself he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see the light. man that is in honor and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish.  a psalm of asaph. the mighty one god jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined forth. our god cometh and doth not keep silence a fire devoureth before him and it is very tempestuous round about him. he calleth to the heavens above and to the earth that he may judge his people gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself. selah hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify unto thee i am god [even] thy god. i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices and thy burnt offerings are continually before me.  i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds. for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills. i know all the birds of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine. if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof. will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto god the sacrifice of thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me. but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes and that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee when thou sawest a thief thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers. thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit. thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mothers son.  these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such a one as thyself [but] i will reprove thee and set [them] in order before thine eyes. now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his way [aright] will i show the salvation of god. for the chief musician. a psalm of david when nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone in to bathsheba. have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. for i know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. against thee thee only have i sinned and done that which is evil in thy sight that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest. behold i was brought forth in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me. behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.  purify me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow. make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities. create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me. cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me. restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee. deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. for thou delightest not in sacrifice else would i give it thou hast no pleasure in burnt offering. the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise. do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem.  then will thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness in burntoffering and in whole burnt offering then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar. for the chief musician. maschil of david when doeg the edomite came and told saul and said unto him david is come to the house of abimelech. why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the lovingkindness of god [endureth] continually. thy tongue deviseth very wickedness like a sharp razor working deceitfully. thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness. selah thou lovest all devouring words thou deceitful tongue. god will likewise destroy thee for ever he will take thee up and pluck thee out of thy tent and root thee out of the land of the living. selah the righteous also shall see [it] and fear and shall laugh at him [saying] lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness. but as for me i am like a green olivetree in the house of god i trust in the lovingkindness of god for ever and ever.  i will give thee thanks for ever because thou hast done it and i will hope in thy name for it is good in the presence of thy saints. for the chief musician set to mahalath. maschil of david. the fool hath said in his heart there is no god. corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good. god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek after god. every one of them is gone back they are together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one. have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people [as] they eat bread and call not upon god there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because of god hath rejected them. oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people then shall jacob rejoice [and] israel shall be glad.  for the chief musician on stringed instruments. maschil of david when the ziphites came and said to saul doth not david hide himself with us save me o god by thy name and judge me in thy might. hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth. for strangers are risen up against me and violent men have sought after my soul they have not set god before them. selah behold god is my helper the lord is of them that uphold my soul. he will requite the evil unto mine enemies destroy thou them in thy truth. with a freewill offering will i sacrifice unto thee i will give thanks unto thy name o jehovah for it is good. for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen [my desire] upon mine enemies. for the chief musician on stringed instruments. maschil of david. give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication. attend unto me and answer me i am restless in my complaint and moan because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in anger they persecute me.  my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me. and i said oh that i had wings like a dove then would i fly away and be at rest. lo then would i wander far off i would lodge in the wilderness. selah i would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest. destroy o lord [and] divide their tongue for i have seen violence and strife in the city. day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. wickedness is in the midst thereof oppression and guile depart not from its streets. for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my companion and my familiar friend. we took sweet counsel together we walked in the house of god with the throng. let death come suddenly upon them let them go down alive into sheol for wickedness is in their dwelling in the midst of them. as for me i will call upon god and jehovah will save me.  evening and morning and at noonday will i complain and moan and he will hear my voice. he hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for they were many [that strove] with me. god will hear and answer them even he that abideth of old selah [the men] who have no changes and who fear not god. he hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him he hath profaned his covenant. his mouth was smooth as butter but his heart was war his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords. cast thy burden upon jehovah and he will sustain thee he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. but thou o god wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee. for the chief musician set to jonath elem rehokim.

will deliver the needy when he crieth and the poor that hath no helper. he will have pity on the poor and needy and the souls of the needy he will save. he will redeem their soul from oppression and violence and precious will their blood be in his sight and they shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba and men shall pray for him continually they shall bless him all the day long. there shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him happy. blessed be jehovah god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. amen and amen. the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended. book iii a psalm of asaph. surely god is good to israel [even] to such as are pure in heart.  but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped. for i was envious at the arrogant when i saw the prosperity of the wicked. for there are no pangs in their death but their strength is firm. they are not in trouble as [other] men neither are they plagued like [other] men. therefore pride is as a chain about their neck violence covereth them as a garment. their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish. they scoff and in wickedness utter oppression they speak loftily. they have set their mouth in the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth. therefore his people return hither and waters of a full [cup] are drained by them. and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the wicked and being alway at ease they increase in riches. surely in vain have i cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning. if i had said i will speak thus behold i had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.  when i thought how i might know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god and considered their latter end. surely thou settest them in slippery places thou castest them down to destruction. how are they become a desolation in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors. as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou wilt despise their image. for my soul was grieved and i was pricked in my heart so brutish was i and ignorant i was [as] a beast before thee. nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden my right hand. thou wilt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory. whom have i in heaven [but thee] and there is none upon earth that i desire besides thee. my flesh and my heart faileth [but] god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot [departing] from thee. but it is good for me to draw near unto god i have made the lord jehovah my refuge that i may tell of all thy works.  maschil of asaph. o god why hast thou cast [us] off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture remember thy congregation which thou hast gotten of old which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance [and] mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt. lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.  thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly they have set up their ensigns for signs. they seemed as men that lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees. and now all the carved work thereof they break down with hatchet and hammers. they have set thy sanctuary on fire they have profaned the dwellingplace of thy name [by casting it] to the ground. they said in their heart let us make havoc of them altogether they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land. we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. how long o god shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever  why drawest thou back thy hand even thy right hand [pluck it] out of thy bosom [and] consume [them]. yet god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth. thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.  thou didst cleave fountain and flood thou driedst up mighty rivers. the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun. thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter. remember this that the enemy hath reproached o jehovah and that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name. oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild beast forget not the life of thy poor for ever. have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence. oh let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name. arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.  forget not the voice of thine adversaries the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually. for the chief musician [set to] altashheth. a psalm of asaph a song. we give thanks unto thee o god we give thanks for thy name is near men tell of thy wondrous works. when i shall find the set time i will judge uprightly. the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i have set up the pillars of it. selah  i said unto the arrogant deal not arrogantly and to the wicked lift not up the horn lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck. for neither from the east nor from the west nor yet from the south [cometh] lifting up. but god is the judge he putteth down one and lifteth up another. for in the hand of jehovah there is a cup and the wine foameth it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same surely the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall drain them and drink them. but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of jacob. all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.  for the chief musician on stringed instruments. a psalm of asaph a song. in judah is god known his name is great in israel. in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion. there he brake the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle. selah glorious art thou [and] excellent from the mountains of prey. the stouthearted are made a spoil they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands. at thy rebuke o god of jacob both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep. thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was still when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth. selah surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. vow and pay unto jehovah your god let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. he will cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth.  for the chief musician after the manner of jeduthan. a psalm of asaph. i will cry unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he will give ear unto me. in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my hand was stretched out in the night and slacked not my soul refused to be comforted. i remember god and am disquieted i complain and my spirit is overwhelmed. selah thou holdest mine eyes watching i am so troubled that i cannot speak. i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times. i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit maketh diligent search. will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favorable no more is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermore hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah and i said this is my infirmity [but i will remember] the years of the right hand of the most high. i will make mention of the deeds of jehovah for i will remember thy wonders of old. i will meditate also upon all thy work and muse on thy doings.  thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is a great god like unto god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph. selah the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also trembled. the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad. the voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook. thy way was in the sea and thy paths in the great waters and thy footsteps were not known. thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron. maschil of asaph. give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth. i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us. we will not hide them from their children telling to the generation to come the praises of jehovah and his strength and his wondrous works that he hath done.  for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know [them] even the children that should be born who should arise and tell [them] to their children that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god. the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle. they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law and they forgat his doings and his wondrous works that he had showed them. marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan. he clave the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as a heap. in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire. he clave rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.  he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers. yet went they on still to sin against him to rebel against the most high in the desert. and they tempted god in their heart by asking food according to their desire. yea they spake against god they said can god prepare a table in the wilderness behold he smote the rock so that waters gushed out and streams overflowed can he give bread also will he provide flesh for his people therefore jehovah heard and was wroth and a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also went up against israel because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation. yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven and he rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them food from heaven. man did eat the bread of the mighty he sent them food to the full. he caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and by his power he guided the south wind. he rained flesh also upon them as the dust and winged birds as the sand of the seas  and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations. so they did eat and were well filled and he gave them their own desire. they were not estranged from that which they desired their food was yet in their mouths when the anger of god went up against them and slew of the fattest of them and smote down the young men of israel. for all this they sinned still and believed not in his wondrous works. therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in terror. when he slew them then they inquired after him and they returned and sought god earnestly. and they remembered that god was their rock and the most high god their redeemer. but they flattered him with their mouth and lied unto him with their tongue. for their heart was not right with him neither were they faithful in his covenant. but he being merciful forgave [their] iniquity and destroyed [them] not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath. and he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again.  how oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert and they turned again and tempted god and provoked the holy one of israel. they remember not his hand nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary how he set his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan and turned their rivers into blood and their streams so that they could not drink. he sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them. he gave also their increase unto the caterpillar and their labor unto the locust. he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomoretrees with frost. he gave over their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble a band of angels of evil. he made a path for his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tents of ham. but he led forth his own people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  and he led them safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary to this mountain which his right hand had gotten. he drove out the nations also before them and allotted them for an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents. yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high god and kept not his testimonies but turned back and dealt treacherously like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. when god heard [this] he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the adversarys hand. he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance. fire devoured their young men and their virgins had no marriage song. their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation.  then the lord awaked as one out of sleep like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. and he smote his adversaries backward he put them to a perpetual reproach. moreover he refused the tent of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved. and he built his sanctuary like the heights like the earth which he hath established for ever. he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds from following the ewes that have their young he brought him to be the shepherd of jacob his people and israel his inheritance. so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. a psalm of asaph. o god the nations are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem in heaps. the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them.  we are become a reproach to our neighbors a scoffing and derision to them that are round about us. how long o jehovah wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his habitation. remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers let thy tender mercies speedily meet us for we are brought very low. help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and forgive our sins for thy names sake. wherefore should the nations say where is their god let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the nations in our sight. let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death and render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord.  so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will show forth thy praise to all generations. for the chief musician set to shoshanim eduth.. a psalm of asaph. give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that sittest [above] the cherubim shine forth. before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy might and come to save us. turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved. o jehovah god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou hast fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in large measure. thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors and our enemies laugh among themselves. turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved. thou broughtest a vine out of egypt thou didst drive out the nations and plantedst it. thou preparedst [room] before it and it took deep root and filled the land. the mountains were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were [like] cedars of god.  it sent out its branches unto the sea and its shoots unto the river. why hast thou broken down its walls so that all they that pass by the way do pluck it the boar out of the wood doth ravage it and the wild beasts of the field feed on it. turn again we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the stock which thy right hand planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. so shall we not go back from thee quicken thou us and we will call upon thy name. turn us again o jehovah god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved. for the chief musician set to the gittith. [a psalm] of asaph. sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob. raise a song and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery. blow the trumpet at the new moon at the full moon on our feastday. for it is a statute for israel an ordinance of the god of jacob.  he appointed it in joseph for a testimony when he went out over the land of egypt [where] i heard a language that i knew not. i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were freed from the basket. thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah. selah hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wouldest hearken unto me there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. i am jehovah thy god who brought thee up out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it. but my people hearkened not to my voice and israel would none of me. so i let them go after the stubbornness of their heart that they might walk in their own counsels. oh that my people would hearken unto me that israel would walk in my ways i would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries. the haters of jehovah should submit themselves unto him but their time should endure for ever.  he would feed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock would i satisfy thee. a psalm of asaph. god standeth in the congregation of god he judgeth among the gods. how long will ye judge unjustly and respect the persons of the wicked selah judge the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and destitute. rescue the poor and needy deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. they know not neither do they understand they walk to and fro in darkness all the foundations of the earth are shaken. i said ye are gods and all of you sons of the most high. nevertheless ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes. arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all the nations. a song. a psalm of asaph. o god keep not thou silence hold not thy peace and be not still o god. for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. thy take crafty counsel against thy people and consult together against thy hidden ones. they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance.  for they have consulted together with one consent against thee do they make a covenant the tents of edom and the ishmaelites moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek philistia with the inhabitants of tyre assyria also is joined with them they have helped the children of lot. selah do thou unto them as unto midian as to sisera as to jabin at the river kishon who perished at endor who became as dung for the earth. make their nobles like oreb and zeeb yea all their princes like zebah and zalmunna who said let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of god. o my god make them like the whirling dust as stubble before the wind. as the fire that burneth the forest and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire so pursue them with thy tempest and terrify them with thy storm. fill their faces with confusion that they may seek thy name o jehovah. let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever yea let them be confounded and perish that they may know that thou alone whose name is jehovah art the most high over all the earth.  for the chief musician set to the gittith. a psalm of the sons of korah.

and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o jehovah of hosts my king and my god. blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee. selah blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the highways [to zion]. passing through the valley of weeping they make it a place of springs yea the early rain covereth it with blessings. they go from strength to strength every one of them appeareth before god in zion. o jehovah god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob. selah behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed. for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.  for jehovah god is a sun and a shield jehovah will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.  o jehovah of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. for the chief musician. a psalm of the sons of korah. jehovah thou hast been favorable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob. thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin. selah thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned [thyself] from the fierceness of thine anger. turn us o god of our salvation and cause thine indignation toward us to cease. wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not quicken us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy lovingkindness o jehovah and grant us thy salvation. i will hear what god jehovah will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly. surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land.  mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other. truth springeth out of the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven. yea jehovah will give that which is good and our land shall yield its increase.  righteousness shall go before him and shall make his footsteps a way [to walk in]. a prayer of david bow down thine ear o jehovah and answer me for i am poor and needy. preserve my soul for i am godly o thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee. be merciful unto me o lord for unto thee do i cry all the day long. rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul. for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee. give ear o jehovah unto my prayer and hearken unto the voice of my supplications. in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt answer me. there is none like unto thee among the gods o lord neither [are there any works] like unto thy works. all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and they shall glorify thy name.  for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god alone. teach me thy way o jehovah i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name. i will praise thee o lord my god with my whole heart and i will glorify thy name for evermore.  for great is thy lovingkindness toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest sheol. o god the proud are risen up against me and a company of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them. but thou o lord art a god merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth. oh turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thy handmaid. show me a token for good that they who hate me may see it and be put to shame because thou jehovah hast helped me and comforted me. a psalm of the

my prayer enter into thy presence incline thine ear unto my cry. for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto sheol. i am reckoned with them that go down into the pit i am as a man that hath no help cast off among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand. thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in dark places in the deeps. thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. selah  thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth. mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction i have called daily upon thee o jehovah i have spread forth my hands unto thee. wilt thou show wonders to the dead shall they that are decreased arise and praise thee selah shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy faithfulness in destruction shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness but unto thee o jehovah have i cried and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. jehovah why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer thy terrors i am distracted. thy fierce wrath is gone over me thy terrors have cut me off. they came round about me like water all the day long they compassed me about together. lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into darkness.  maschil of ethan the ezrahite. i will sing of the lovingkindness of jehovah for ever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations. for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens. i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations. selah and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o jehovah thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. for who in the skies can be compared unto jehovah who among the sons of the mighty is like unto jehovah a god very terrible in the council of the holy ones and to be feared above all them that are round about him o jehovah god of hosts who is a mighty one like unto thee o jehovah and thy faithfulness is round about thee. thou rulest the pride of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them. thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength. the heavens are thine the earth also is thine the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them.  the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon rejoice in thy name. thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand. righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne lovingkindness and truth go before thy face. blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they walk o jehovah in the light of thy countenance. in thy name do they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness are they exalted. for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted. for our shield belongeth unto jehovah and our king to the holy one of israel. then thou spakest in vision to thy saints and saidst i have laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of the people. i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed him with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him. the enemy shall not exact from him nor the son of wickedness afflict him. and i will beat down his adversaries before him and smite them that hate him.  but my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him and in my name shall his horn be exalted. i will set his hand also on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation. i also will make him [my] first born the highest of the kings of the earth. my lovingkindness will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him. his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as the days of heaven. if his children forsake my law and walk not in mine ordinances if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes. but my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. once have i sworn by my holiness i will not lie unto david his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me. it shall be established for ever as the moon and [as] the faithful witness in the sky. selah  but thou hast cast off and rejected thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant thou hast profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground. thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin. all that pass by the way rob him he is become a reproach to his neighbors. thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. yea thou turnest back the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle. thou hast made his brightness to cease and cast his throne down to the ground. the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him with shame. selah how long o jehovah wilt thou hide thyself for ever [how long] shall thy wrath burn like fire oh remember how short my time is for what vanity hast thou created all the children of men what man is he that shall live and not see death that shall deliver his soul from the power of sheol selah lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest unto david in thy faithfulness  remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] all the mighty peoples wherewith thine enemies have reproached o jehovah wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. blessed be jehovah for evermore. amen and amen. book iv a prayer of moses the man of god. lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god. thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children of men. for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night. thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth. for we are consumed in thine anger and in thy wrath are we troubled. thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.  for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we bring our years to an end as a sigh. the days of our years are threescore years and ten or even by reason of strength fourscore years yet is their pride but labor and sorrow for it is soon gone and we fly away. who knoweth the power of thine anger and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee so teach us to number our days that we may get us a heart of wisdom. return o jehovah how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil. let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory upon their children. and let the favor of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it. he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. i will say of jehovah he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust.  for he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. he will cover thee with his pinions and under his wings shalt thou take refuge his truth is a shield and a buckler. thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand [but] it shall not come nigh thee. only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. for thou o jehovah art my refuge thou hast made the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. for he will give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot. because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name.  he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him. with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation. a psalm a song for the sabbath day. it is a good thing to give thanks unto jehovah and to sing praises unto thy name o most high to show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night with an instrument of ten strings and with the psaltery with a solemn sound upon the harp. for thou jehovah hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands. how great are thy works o jehovah thy thoughts are very deep. a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever. but thou o jehovah art on high for evermore. for lo thine enemies o jehovah for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. but my horn hast thou exalted like [the horn of] the wildox i am anointed with fresh oil.  mine eye also hath seen [my desire] on mine enemies mine ears have heard [my desire] of the evildoers that rise up against me. the righteous shall flourish like the palmtree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon. they are planted in the house of jehovah they shall flourish in the courts of our god. they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be full of sap and green to show that jehovah is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him. jehovah reigneth he is clothed with majesty jehovah is clothed with strength he hath girded himself therewith the world also is established that it cannot be moved. thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting. the floods have lifted up o jehovah the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves. above the voices of many waters the mighty breakers of the sea jehovah on high is mighty. thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thy house o jehovah for evermore. o jehovah thou god to whom vengeance belongeth thou god to whom vengeance belongeth shine forth.  lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render to the proud [their] desert. jehovah how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph they prate they speak arrogantly all the workers of iniquity boast themselves. they break in pieces thy people o jehovah and afflict thy heritage. they slay the widow and the sojourner and murder the fatherless. and they say jehovah will not see neither will the god of jacob consider. consider ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see he that chastiseth the nations shall not he correct [even] he that teacheth man knowledge jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity. blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o jehovah and teachest out of thy law that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked. for jehovah will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance. for judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it.  who will rise up for me against the evildoers who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity unless jehovah had been my help my soul had soon dwelt in silence. when i said my foot slippeth thy lovingkindness o jehovah held me up. in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by statute they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood. but jehovah hath been my high tower and my god the rock of my refuge. and he hath brought upon them their own iniquity and will cut them off in their own wickedness jehovah our god will cut them off. oh come let us sing unto jehovah let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. let us come before his presence with thanksgiving let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. for jehovah is a great god and a great king above all gods. in his hand are the deep places of the earth the heights of the mountains are his also. the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land.  oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before jehovah our maker for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. today oh that ye would hear his voice harden not your heart as at meribah as in the day of massah in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work. forty years long was i grieved with [that] generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways wherefore i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. oh sing unto jehovah a new song sing unto jehovah all the earth. sing unto jehovah bless his name show forth his salvation from day to day. declare his glory among the nations his marvellous works among all the peoples. for great is jehovah and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods. for all the gods of the peoples are idols but

all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy before jehovah for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with his truth. jehovah reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad. clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. a fire goeth before him and burneth up his adversaries round about. his lightnings lightened the world the earth saw and trembled.  the mountains melted like wax at the presence of jehovah at the presence of the lord of the whole earth. the heavens declare his righteousness and all the peoples have seen his glory. let all them be put to shame that serve graven images that boast themselves of idols worship him all ye gods. zion heard and was glad and the daughters of judah rejoiced because of thy judgments o jehovah. for thou jehovah art most high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods. o ye that love jehovah hate evil he preserveth the souls of his saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart. be glad in jehovah ye righteous and give thanks to his holy memorial [name]. a psalm. oh sing unto jehovah a new song for he hath done marvellous things his right hand and his holy arm hath wrought salvation for him. jehovah hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.  he hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god.  make a joyful noise unto jehovah all the earth break forth and sing for joy yea sing praises. sing praises unto jehovah with the harp with the harp and the voice of melody. with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the king jehovah. let the sea roar and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein let the floods clap their hands let the hills sing for joy together before jehovah for he cometh to judge the earth he will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity. jehovah reigneth let the peoples tremble he sitteth [above] the cherubim let the earth be moved. jehovah is great in zion and he is high above all the peoples. let them praise thy great and terrible name holy is he. the kings strength also loveth justice thou dost establish equity thou executest justice and righteousness in jacob. exalt ye jehovah our god and worship at his footstool holy is he.  moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name they called upon jehovah and he answered them. he spake unto them in the pillar of cloud they kept his testimonies and the statute that he gave them.  thou answeredst them o jehovah our god thou wast a god that forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. exalt ye jehovah our god and worship at his holy hill for jehovah our god is holy. a psalm of thanksgiving. make a joyful noise unto jehovah all ye lands. serve jehovah with gladness come before his presence with singing. know ye that jehovah he is god it is he that hath made us and we are his we are his people and the sheep of his pasture. enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise give thanks unto him and bless his name. for jehovah is good his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and his faithfulness unto all generations. a psalm of david. i will sing of lovingkindness and justice unto thee o jehovah will i sing praises.  i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way oh when wilt thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart. i will set no base thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave unto me. a perverse heart shall depart from me i will know no evil thing. whoso privily slandereth his neighbor him will i destroy him that hath a high look and a proud heart will i not suffer.  mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall minister unto me. he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. morning by morning will i destroy all the wicked of the land to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of jehovah. a prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed and poureth out his complaint before jehovah. hear my prayer o jehovah and let my cry come unto thee. hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily.  for my days consume away like smoke and my bones are burned as a firebrand. my heart is smitten like grass and withered for i forget to eat my bread. by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am become as an owl of the waste places. i watch and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. mine enemies reproach me all the day they that are mad against me do curse by me. for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast taken me up and cast me away. my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass. but thou o jehovah wilt abide for ever and thy memorial [name] unto all generations. thou wilt arise and have mercy upon zion for it is time to have pity upon her yea the set time is come. for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and have pity upon her dust. so the nations shall fear the name of jehovah and all the kings of the earth thy glory.  for jehovah hath built up zion he hath appeared in his glory. he hath regarded the prayer of the destitute and hath not despised their prayer. this shall be written for the generation to come and a people which shall be created shall praise jehovah. for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did jehovah behold the earth to hear the sighing of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death that men may declare the name of jehovah in zion and his praise in jerusalem when the peoples are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve jehovah. he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days. i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations. of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands. they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end.  the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee. [a psalm] of david. bless jehovah o my soul and all that is within me [bless] his holy name. bless jehovah o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfieth thy desire with good things [so that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle. jehovah executeth righteous acts and judgments for all that are oppressed. he made known his ways unto moses his doings unto the children of israel. jehovah is merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness. he will not always chide neither will he keep [his anger] for ever. he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us after our iniquities. for as the heavens are high above the earth so great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him. as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  like as a father pitieth his children so jehovah pitieth them that fear him. for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust. as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth. for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more. but the lovingkindness of jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto childrens children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his precepts to do them. jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all. bless jehovah ye his angels that are mighty in strength that fulfil his word hearkening unto the voice of his word. bless jehovah all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure. bless jehovah all ye his works in all places of his dominion bless jehovah o my soul. bless jehovah o my soul. o jehovah my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain  who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh winds his messengers flames of fire his ministers who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved for ever. thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture the waters stood above the mountains. at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away the mountains rose the valleys sank down unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth. he sendeth forth springs into the valleys they run among the mountains they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst. by them the birds of the heavens have their habitation they sing among the branches. he watereth the mountains from his chambers the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth  and wine that maketh glad the heart of man [and] oil to make his face to shine and bread that strengtheneth mans heart. the trees of jehovah are filled [with moisture] the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted where the birds make their nests as for the stork the firtrees are her house. the high mountains are for the wild goats the rocks are a refuge for the conies. he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down. thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. the young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from god. the sun ariseth they get them away and lay them down in their dens. man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening. o jehovah how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches. yonder is the sea great and wide wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts. there go the ships there is leviathan whom thou hast formed to play therein. these wait all for thee that thou mayest give them their food in due season.  thou givest unto them they gather thou openest thy hand they are satisfied with good. thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust. thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the ground. let the glory of jehovah endure for ever let jehovah rejoice in his works who looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the mountains and they smoke. i will sing unto jehovah as long as i live i will sing praise to my god while i have any being. let thy meditation be sweet unto him i will rejoice in jehovah. let sinners be consumed out of the earth. and let the wicked be no more. bless jehovah o my soul. praise ye jehovah. oh give thanks unto jehovah call upon his name make known among the peoples his doings. sing unto him sing praises unto him talk ye of all his marvelous works. glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek jehovah. seek ye jehovah and his strength seek his face evermore. remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth  o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones. he is jehovah our god his judgments are in all the earth. he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations [the covenant] which he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a statute to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and sojourners in it. and they went about from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people. he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes [saying] touch not mine anointed ones and do my prophets no harm. and he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread. he sent a man before them joseph was sold for a servant his feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in [chains of] iron until the time that his word came to pass the word of jehovah tried him.  the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of peoples and let him go free. he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his elders wisdom. israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham. and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their adversaries. he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtly with his servants. he sent moses his servant [and] aaron whom he had chosen. they set among them his signs and wonders in the land of ham. he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his words. he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish. their land swarmed with frogs in the chambers of their kings. he spake and there came swarms of flies and lice in all their borders. he gave them hail for rain [and] flaming fire in their land. he smote their vines also and their figtrees and brake the trees of their borders. he spake and the locust came and the grasshopper and that without number  and did eat up every herb in their land and did eat up the fruit of their ground. he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength. and he brought them forth with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among his tribes. egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them had fallen upon them. he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night. they asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. he opened the rock and waters gushed out they ran in the dry places [like] a river. for he remembered his holy word [and] abraham his servant. and he brought forth his people with joy [and] his chosen with singing. and he gave them the lands of the nations and they took the labor of the peoples in possession that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah. oh give thanks unto jehovah for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] forever. who can utter the mighty acts of jehovah or show forth all his praise  blessed are they that keep justice and he that doeth righteousness at all times. remember me o jehovah with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people oh visit me with thy salvation that i may see the prosperity of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance. we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly. our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses but were rebellious at the sea even at the red sea. nevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he might make his mighty power to be known. he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through a wilderness. and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. and the waters covered their adversaries there was not one of them left. then believed they his words they sang his praise. they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel  but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert. and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul. they envied moses also in the camp [and] aaron the saint of jehovah. the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram. and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked. they made a calf in horeb and worshipped a molten image. thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. they forgat god their saviour who had done great things in egypt wondrous works in the land of ham [and] terrible things by the red sea. therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy [them]. yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of jehovah. therefore he sware unto them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness and that he would overthrow their seed among the nations and scatter them in the lands.  they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead. thus they provoked him to anger with their doings and the plague brake in upon them. then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed. and that was reckoned unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. they angered him also at the waters of meribah so that it went ill with moses for their sakes because they were rebellious against his spirit and he spake unadvisedly with his lips. they did not destroy the peoples as jehovah commanded them but mingled themselves with the nations and learned their works and served their idols which became a snare unto them. yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood. thus were they defiled with their works and played the harlot in their doings.  therefore was the wrath of jehovah kindled against his people and he abhorred his inheritance. and he gave them into the hand of the nations and they that hated them ruled over them. their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand. many times did he deliver them but they were rebellious in their counsel and were brought low in their iniquity. nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive. save us o jehovah our god and gather us from among the nations to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise. blessed be jehovah the god of israel from everlasting even to everlasting. and let all the people say amen. praise ye jehovah. book v o give thanks unto jehovah for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. let the redeemed of jehovah say [so] whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary  and gathered out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south. they wandered in the wilderness in a desert way they found no city of habitation. hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them. then they cried unto jehovah in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses he led them also by a straight way that they might go to a city of habitation. oh that men would praise jehovah for his lovingkindness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and the hungry soul he filleth with good. such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help. then they cried unto jehovah in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses. he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bonds in sunder.  oh that men would praise jehovah for his lovingkindness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder. fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted. their soul abhorreth all manner of food and they draw near unto the gates of death. then they cry unto jehovah in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses. he sendeth his word and healeth them and delivereth [them] from their destructions. oh that men would praise jehovah for his lovingkindness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with singing. they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of jehovah and his wonders in the deep. for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof. they mount up to the heavens they go down again to the depths their soul melteth away because of trouble.  they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end.  then they cry unto jehovah in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses. he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still. then are they glad because they are quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. oh that men would praise jehovah for his lovingkindness and for his wonderful works to the children of men let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people and praise him in the seat of the elders. he turneth rivers into a wilderness and watersprings into a thirsty ground a fruitful land into a salt desert for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. he turneth a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into watersprings. and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city of habitation and sow fields and plant vineyards and get them fruits of increase. he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. again they are diminished and bowed down through oppression trouble and sorrow.  he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the waste where there is no way.  yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction and maketh [him] families like a flock. the upright shall see it and be glad and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. whoso is wise will give heed to these things and they will consider the lovingkindnesses of jehovah. a song a psalm of david. my heart is fixed o god i will sing yea i will sing praises even with my glory. awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake right early. i will give thanks unto thee o jehovah among the peoples and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations. for thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens and thy truth [reacheth] unto the skies. be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth. that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and answer us. god hath spoken in his holiness i will exult i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth. gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the defence of my head judah is my sceptre.  moab is my washpot upon edom will i cast my shoe over philistia will i shout. who will bring me into the fortified city who hath led me unto edom hast not thou cast us off o god and thou goest not forth o god with our hosts.  give us help against the adversary for vain is the help of man. through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that will tread down our adversaries. for the chief musicion. a psalm of david. hold not thy peace o god of my praise for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me they have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. they have compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause. for my love they are my adversaries but i [give myself unto] prayer. and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love. set thou a wicked man over him and let an adversary stand at his right hand. when he is judged let him come forth guilty and let his prayer be turned into sin. let his days be few [and] let another take his office.  let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. let his children be vagabonds and beg and let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places. let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let strangers make spoil of his labor. let there be none to extend kindness unto him neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. let his posterity be cut off in the generation following let their name be blotted out. let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with jehovah and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. let them be before jehovah continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth because he remembered not to show kindness but persecuted the poor and needy man and the broken in heart to slay [them]. yea he loved cursing and it came unto him and he delighted not in blessing and it was far from him. he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment and it came into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones. let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.  this is the reward of mine adversaries from jehovah and of them that speak evil against my soul. but deal thou with me o jehovah the lord for thy names sake because thy lovingkindness is good deliver thou me for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me. i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust. my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness. i am become also a reproach unto them when they see me they shake their head. help me o jehovah my god oh save me according to thy lovingkindness that they may know that this is thy hand [that] thou jehovah hast done it. let them curse but bless thou when they arise they shall be put to shame but thy servant shall rejoice. let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe. i will give great thanks unto jehovah with my mouth yea i will praise him among the multitude. for he will stand at the right hand of the needy to save him from them that judge his soul.  a psalm of david. jehovah saith unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool. jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power in holy array out of the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth. jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. the lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. he will judge among the nations he will fill [the places] with dead bodies he will strike through the head in many countries. he will drink of the brook in the way therefore will he lift up the head. praise ye jehovah. i will give thanks unto jehovah with my whole heart in the council of the upright and in the congregation. the works of jehovah are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. his work is honor and majesty and his righteousness endureth for ever. he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered jehovah is gracious and merciful.  he hath given food unto them that fear him he will ever be mindful of his covenant. he hath showed his people the power of his works in giving them the heritage of the nations. the works of his hands are truth and justice all his precepts are sure. they are established for ever and ever they are done in truth and uprightness. he hath sent redemption unto his people he hath commanded his covenant for ever holy and reverend is his name. the fear of jehovah is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do [his commandments] his praise endureth for ever. praise ye jehovah. blessed is the man that feareth jehovah that delighteth greatly in his commandments. his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed. wealth and riches are in his house and his righteousness endureth for ever. unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness [he is] gracious and merciful and righteous. well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth he shall maintain his cause in judgment.  for he shall never be moved the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in jehovah. his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see [his desire] upon his adversaries. he hath dispersed he hath given to the needy his righteousness endureth for ever his horn shall be exalted with honor. the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked shall perish. praise ye jehovah. praise o ye servants of jehovah praise the name of jehovah. blessed be the name of jehovah from this time forth and for evermore. from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same jehovahs name is to be praised. jehovah is high above all nations and his glory above the heavens. who is like unto jehovah our god that hath his seat on high that humbleth himself to behold [the things that are] in heaven and in the earth he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people.  he maketh the barren woman to keep house [and to be] a joyful mother of children. praise ye jehovah. when israel went forth out of egypt the house of jacob from a people of strange language judah became his sanctuary israel his dominion. the sea saw it and fled the jordan was driven back. the mountains skipped like rams the little hills like lambs. what aileth thee o thou sea that thou fleest thou jordan that thou turnest back ye mountains that ye skip like rams ye little hills like lambs tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of jacob who turned the rock into a pool of water the flint into a fountain of waters. not unto us o jehovah not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy lovingkindness and for thy truths sake. wherefore should the nations say where is now their god but our god is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he pleased. their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands. they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they have ears but they hear not noses have they but they smell not  they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they walk not neither speak they through their throat. they that make them shall be like unto them yea every one that trusteth in them. o israel trust thou in jehovah he is their help and their shield. o house of aaron trust ye in jehovah he is their help and their shield. ye that fear jehovah trust in jehovah he is their help and their shield. jehovah hath been mindful of us he will bless [us] he will bless the house of israel he will bless the house of aaron. he will bless them that fear jehovah both small and great. jehovah increase you more and more you and your children. blessed are ye of jehovah who made heaven and earth. the heavens are the heavens of jehovah but the earth hath he given to the children of men. the dead praise not jehovah neither any that go down into silence but we will bless jehovah from this time forth and for evermore. praise ye jehovah. i love jehovah because he heareth my voice and my supplications. because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call [upon him] as long as i live.  the cords of

lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. let them now that fear jehovah say that his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. out of my distress i called upon jehovah jehovah answered me [and set me] in a large place. jehovah is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me jehovah is on my side among them that help me therefore shall i see [my desire] upon them that hate me. it is better to take refuge in jehovah than to put confidence in man. it is better to take refuge in jehovah than to put confidence in princes.  all nations compassed me about in the name of jehovah i will cut them off. they compassed me about yea they compassed me about in the name of jehovah i will cut them off. they compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns in the name of jehovah i will cut them off. thou didst thrust sore at me that i might fall but jehovah helped me. jehovah is my strength and song and he is become my salvation. the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous the right hand of jehovah doeth valiantly. the right hand of jehovah is exalted the right hand of jehovah doeth valiantly. i shall not die but live and declare the works of jehovah.

righteous shall enter into it. i will give thanks unto thee for thou hast answered me and art become my salvation. the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. this is jehovahs doing it is marvellous in our eyes.  this is the day which jehovah hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it. save now we beseech thee o jehovah o jehovah we beseech thee send now

arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper. woe is me that i sojourn in meshech that i dwell among the tents of kedar my soul hath long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. i am [for] peace but when i speak they are for war. a song of ascents. i will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence shall my help come my help [cometh] from jehovah who made heaven and earth. he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber. behold he that keepeth israel will neither slumber nor sleep.  jehovah is thy keeper jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand. the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. jehovah will keep thee from all evil he will keep thy soul. jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and for evermore. a song of ascents of david. i was glad when they said unto me let us go unto the house of jehovah. our feet are standing within thy gates o jerusalem jerusalem that art builded as a city that is compact together whither the tribes go up even the tribes of jehovah [for] an ordinance for israel to give thanks unto the name of jehovah. for there are set thrones for judgment the thrones of the house of david. pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee. peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces. for my brethren and companions sakes i will now say peace be within thee. for the sake of the house of jehovah our god i will seek thy good. a song of ascents. unto thee do i lift up mine eyes o thou that sittest in the heavens.  behold as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hand of their master as the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes [look] unto jehovah our god until he have mercy upon us. have mercy upon us o jehovah have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud. a song of ascents of david. if it had not been jehovah who was on our side let israel now say if it had not been jehovah who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up alive when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul. blessed be jehovah who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped. our help is in the name of jehovah who made heaven and earth.  a song of ascents. they that trust in jehovah are as mount zion which cannot be moved but abideth for ever. as the mountains are round about jerusalem so jehovah is round about his people from this time forth and for evermore. for the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. do good o jehovah unto those that are good and to them that are upright in their hearts. but as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. peace be upon israel. a song of ascents. when jehovah brought back those that returned to zion we were like unto them that dream. then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the nations jehovah hath done great things for them. jehovah hath done great things for us [whereof] we are glad. turn again our captivity o jehovah as the streams in the south. they that sow in tears shall reap in joy.  he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing seed for sowing shall doubtless come again with joy bringing his sheaves [with him]. a song of ascents of solomon. except jehovah build the house they labor in vain that build it except jehovah keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain. it is vain for you to rise up early to take rest late to eat the bread of toil [for] so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. lo children are a heritage of jehovah [and] the fruit of the womb is [his] reward. as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of youth. happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate. a song of ascents. blessed is every one that feareth jehovah that walketh in his ways. for thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee. thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of thy house thy children like olive plants round about thy table. behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth jehovah. jehovah bless thee out of zion and see thou the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life.  yea see thou thy childrens children. peace be upon israel. a song of ascents. many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up let israel now say many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up yet they have not prevailed against me. the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows. jehovah is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. let them be put to shame and turned backward all they that hate zion. let them be as the grass upon the housetops which withereth before it groweth up wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. neither do they that go by say the blessing of jehovah be upon you we bless you in the name of jehovah. a song of ascents. out of the depths have i cried unto thee o jehovah. lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. if thou jehovah shouldest mark iniquities o lord who could stand but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared. i wait for jehovah my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope.  my soul [waiteth] for the lord more than watchmen [wait] for the morning [yea more than] watchmen for the morning. o israel hope in jehovah for with jehovah there is lovingkindness and with him is plenteous redemption. and he will redeem israel from all his iniquities. a song of ascents of david. jehovah my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too wonderful for me. surely i have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with his mother like a weaned child is my soul within me. o israel hope in jehovah from this time forth and for evermore. a song of ascents. jehovah remember for david all his affliction how he sware unto jehovah and vowed unto the mighty one of jacob surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed i will not give sleep to mine eyes or slumber to mine eyelids until i find out a place for jehovah a tabernacle for the mighty one of jacob. lo we heard of it in ephrathah we found it in the field of the wood.  we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his footstool. arise o jehovah into thy restingplace thou and the ark of thy strength. let thy priest be clothed with righteousness and let thy saints shout for joy. for thy servant davids sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. jehovah hath sworn unto david in truth he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne. if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach them their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore. for jehovah hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation. this is my restingplace for ever here will i dwell for i have desired it. i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor with bread. her priests also will i clothe with salvation and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. there will i make the horn of david to bud i have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. his enemies will i clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish. a song of ascents of david. behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity  it is like the precious oil upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aarons beard that came down upon the skirt of his garments like the dew of hermon that cometh down upon the mountains of zion for there jehovah commanded the blessing even life for evermore. a song of ascents. behold bless ye jehovah all ye servants of jehovah that by night stand in the house of jehovah. lift up your hands to the sanctuary and bless ye jehovah. jehovah bless thee out of zion even he that made heaven and earth. praise ye jehovah. praise ye the name of jehovah praise [him] o ye servants of jehovah ye that stand in the house of jehovah in the courts of the house of our god. praise ye jehovah for jehovah is good sing praises unto his name for it is pleasant. for jehovah hath chosen jacob unto himself [and] israel for his own possession. for i know that jehovah is great and that our lord is above all gods. whatsoever jehovah pleased that hath he done in heaven and in earth in the seas and in all deeps  who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth who maketh lightnings for the rain who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries who smote the firstborn of egypt both of man and beast who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee o egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his servants who smote many nations and slew mighty kings sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the kingdoms of canaan and gave their land for a heritage a heritage unto israel his people. thy name o jehovah [endureth] for ever thy memorial [name] o jehovah throughout all generations. for jehovah will judge his people and repent himself concerning his servants. the idols of the nations are silver and gold the work of mens hands. they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths. they that make them shall be like unto them yea every one that trusteth in them. o house of israel bless ye jehovah o house of aaron bless ye jehovah  o house of levi bless ye jehovah ye that fear jehovah bless ye jehovah. blessed be jehovah out of zion who dwelleth at jerusalem. praise ye jehovah. oh give thanks unto jehovah for he is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. oh give thanks unto the god of gods for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. oh give thanks unto the lord of lords for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him who alone doeth great wonders for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that by understanding made the heavens for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that spread forth the earth above the waters for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that made great lights for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever the sun to rule by day for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever the moon and stars to rule by night for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that smote egypt in their firstborn for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever  and brought out israel from among them for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that divided the red sea in sunder for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and made israel to pass through the midst of it for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that led his people through the wilderness for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever to him that smote great kings for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and slew famous kings for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever  sihon king of the amorites for his lovingkindness [endureth] forever and og king of bashan for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and gave their land for a heritage for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever even a heritage unto israel his servant for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever  who remembered us in our low estate for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever and hath delivered us from our adversaries for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever who giveth food to all flesh for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. oh give thanks unto the god of heaven for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion. upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. for there they that led us captive required of us songs and they that wasted us [required of us] mirth [saying] sing us one of the songs of zion. how shall we sing jehovahs song in a foreign land if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget [her skill].  let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i remember thee not if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy. remember o jehovah against the children of edom the day of jerusalem who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof.  o daughter of babylon that art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock. a [psalm] of david. i will give thee thanks with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praises unto thee. i will worship toward thy holy temple and give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. in the day that i called thou answeredst me thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul. all the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks o jehovah for they have heard the words of thy mouth. yea they shall sing of the ways of jehovah for great is the glory of jehovah. for though jehovah is high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the haughty he knoweth from afar. though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand will save me.  jehovah will perfect that which concerneth me thy lovingkindness o jehovah [endureth] for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. o jehovah thou hast searched me and known [me]. thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar off. thou searchest out my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways. for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o jehovah thou knowest it altogether. thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me. [such] knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it. whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in sheol behold thou art there. if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me. if i say surely the darkness shall overwhelm me and the light about me shall be night  even the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike [to thee]. for thou didst form my inward parts thou didst cover me in my mothers womb. i will give thanks unto thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well. my frame was not hidden from thee when i was made in secret [and] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. thine eyes did see mine unformed substance and in thy book they were all written [even] the days that were ordained [for me] when as yet there was none of them. how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee. surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloodthirsty men. for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take [thy name] in vain. do not i hate them o jehovah that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee  i hate them with perfect hatred they are become mine enemies. search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting. for the chief musician. a psalm of david. deliver me o jehovah from the evil man preserve me from the violent man who devise mischiefs in their heart continually do they gather themselves together for war. they have sharpened their tongue like a serpent adders poison is under their lips. selah keep me o jehovah from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me. selah i said unto jehovah thou art my god give ear unto the voice of my supplications o jehovah. o jehovah the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. grant not o jehovah the desires of the wicked further not his evil device [lest] they exalt themselves. selah  as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover them. let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits whence they shall not rise. an evil speaker shall not be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. i know that jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted and justice for the needy. surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presence. a psalm of david. jehovah i have called upon thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when i call unto thee. let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. set a watch o jehovah before my mouth keep the door of my lips. incline not my heart to any evil thing to practise deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties. let the righteous smite me [it shall be] a kindness and let him reprove me [it shall be as] oil upon the head let not my head refuse it for even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.  their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock and they shall hear my words for they are sweet. as when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth our bones are scattered at the mouth of sheol. for mine eyes are unto thee o jehovah the lord in thee do i take refuge leave not my soul destitute. keep me from the snare which they have laid for me and from the gins of the workers of iniquity. let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i withal escape. maschil of david when he was in the cave a prayer. i cry with my voice unto jehovah with my voice unto jehovah do i make supplication. i pour out my complaint before him i show before him my trouble. when my spirit was overwhelmed within me thou knewest my path. in the way wherein i walk have they hidden a snare for me. look on [my] right hand and see for there is no man that knoweth me refuge hath failed me no man careth for my soul. i cried unto thee o jehovah i said thou art my refuge my portion in the land of the living. attend unto my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than i.  bring my soul out of prison that i may give thanks unto thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou wilt deal bountifully with me. a psalm of david. hear my prayer o jehovah give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me [and] in thy righteousness. and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight no man living is righteous. for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in dark places as those that have been long dead. therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate. i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy doings i muse on the work of thy hands. i spread forth my hands unto thee my soul [thirsteth] after thee as a weary land. selah make haste to answer me o jehovah my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i become like them that go down into the pit. cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee.  deliver me o jehovah from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me. teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me in the land of uprightness. quicken me o jehovah for thy names sake in thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble. and in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant. [a psalm] of david. blessed be jehovah my rock who teacheth my hands to war [and] my fingers to fight my lovingkindness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom i take refuge who subdueth my people under me. jehovah what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away. bow thy heavens o jehovah and come down touch the mountains and they shall smoke. cast forth lightning and scatter them send out thine arrows and discomfit them. stretch forth thy hand from above rescue me and deliver me out of great waters out of the hand of aliens  whose mouth speaketh deceit and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a psaltery of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee. thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings who rescueth david his servant from the hurtful sword. rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens whose mouth speaketh deceit and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. when our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth and our daughters as cornerstones hewn after the fashion of a palace [when] our garners are full affording all manner of store [and] our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields [when] our oxen are well laden [when there is] no breaking in and no going forth and no outcry in our streets happy is the people that is in such a case [yea] happy is the people whose god is jehovah. [a] [psalm] [of] praise of david. i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name for ever and ever. every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name for ever and ever. great is jehovah and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable.  one generation shall laud thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts. of the glorious majesty of thine honor and of thy wondrous works will i meditate. and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and i will declare thy greatness. they shall utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness. jehovah is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great lovingkindness. jehovah is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works. all thy works shall give thanks unto thee o jehovah and thy saints shall bless thee. they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion [endureth] throughout all generations. jehovah upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that are bowed down. the eyes of all wait for thee and thou givest them their food in due season. thou openest thy hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. jehovah is righteous in all his ways and gracious in all his works.  jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth. he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them. jehovah preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked will he destroy. my mouth shall speak the praise of jehovah and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. praise ye jehovah. praise jehovah o my soul. while i live will i praise jehovah i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being. put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help. his breath goeth forth he returneth to his earth in that very day his thoughts perish. happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in jehovah his god who made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is who keepeth truth for ever who executeth justice for the oppressed who giveth food to the hungry. jehovah looseth the prisoners jehovah openeth [the eyes of] the blind jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down jehovah loveth the righteous  jehovah preserveth the sojourners he upholdeth the fatherless and widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. jehovah will reign for ever thy god o zion unto all generations. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah for it is good to sing praises unto our god for it is pleasant [and] praise is comely. jehovah doth build up jerusalem he gathereth together the outcasts of israel. he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds. he counteth the number of the stars he calleth them all by [their] names. great is our lord and mighty in power his understanding is infinite. jehovah upholdeth the meek he bringeth the wicked down to the ground. sing unto jehovah with thanksgiving sing praises upon the harp unto our god who covereth the heavens with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. he giveth to the beast his food [and] to the young ravens which cry. he delighteth not in the strength of the horse he taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.  jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him in those that hope in his lovingkindness. praise jehovah o jerusalem praise thy god o zion. for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates he hath blessed thy children within thee. he maketh peace in thy borders he filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. he sendeth out his commandment upon earth his word runneth very swiftly. he giveth snow like wool he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. he casteth forth his ice like morsels who can stand before his cold he sendeth out his word and melteth them he causeth his wind to blow and the waters flow. he showeth his word unto jacob his statutes and his ordinances unto israel. he hath not dealt so with any nation and as for his ordinances they have not known them. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah from the heavens praise him in the heights. praise ye him all his angels praise ye him all his host. praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light. praise him ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that are above the heavens.  let them praise the name of jehovah for he commanded and they were created. he hath also established them for ever and ever he hath made a decree which shall not pass away. praise jehovah from the earth ye seamonsters and all deeps. fire and hail snow and vapor stormy wind fulfilling his word mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars beasts and all cattle creeping things and flying birds kings of the earth and all peoples princes and all judges of the earth both young men and virgins old men and children let them praise the name of jehovah for his name alone is exalted his glory is above the earth and the heavens. and he hath lifted up the horn of his people the praise of all his saints even of the children of israel a people near unto him. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah. sing unto jehovah a new song and his praise in the assembly of the saints. let israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of zion be joyful in their king. let them praise his name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.  for jehovah taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation. let the saints exult in glory let them sing for joy upon their beds. [let] the high praises of god [be] in their mouth and a twoedged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the nations and punishments upon the peoples to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron to execute upon them the judgment written this honor have all his saints. praise ye jehovah. praise ye jehovah. praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power. praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness. praise him with trumpet sound praise him with psaltery and harp. praise him with timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. praise him with loud cymbals praise him with high sounding cymbals. let everything that hath breath praise jehovah. praise ye jehovah. the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel to know wisdom and instruction to discern the words of understanding  to receive instruction in wise dealing in righteousness and justice and equity to give prudence to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion that the wise man may hear and increase in learning and that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels to understand a proverb and a figure the words of the wise and their dark sayings. the fear of jehovah is the beginning of knowledge [but] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck. my son if sinners entice thee consent thou not. if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause let us swallow them up alive as sheol and whole as those that go down into the pit we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoil thou shalt cast thy lot among us we will all have one purse my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.  for in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird and these lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives. so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain it taketh away the life of the owners thereof. wisdom crieth aloud in the street she uttereth her voice in the broad places she crieth in the chief place of concourse at the entrance of the gates in the city she uttereth her words how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and scoffers delight them in scoffing and fools hate knowledge turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit upon you i will make known my words unto you. because i have called and ye have refused i have stretched out my hand and no man hath regarded but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof i also will laugh in [the day of] your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as a storm and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you. then will they call upon me but i will not answer they will seek me diligently but they shall not find me  for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of jehovah they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof. therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices. for the backsliding of the simple shall slay them and the careless ease of fools shall destroy them. but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely and shall be quiet without fear of evil. my son if thou wilt receive my words and lay up my commandments with thee so as to incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding  yea if thou cry after discernment and lift up thy voice for understanding if thou seek her as silver and search for her as for hid treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of jehovah and find the knowledge of god. for jehovah giveth wisdom out of his mouth [cometh] knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the upright [he is] a shield to them that walk in integrity that he may guard the paths of justice and preserve the way of his saints.  then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice and equity [yea] every good path. for wisdom shall enter into thy heart and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul discretion shall watch over thee understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of evil from the men that speak perverse things who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness who rejoice to do evil and delight in the perverseness of evil who are crooked in their ways and wayward in their paths to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words  that forsaketh the friend of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her god for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead none that go unto her return again neither do they attain unto the paths of life that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous. for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in it. but the wicked shall be cut off from the land and the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.  my son forget not my law but let thy heart keep my commandments for length of days and years of life and peace will they add to thee. let not kindness and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the tablet of thy heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man. trust in jehovah with all thy heart and lean not upon thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct thy paths. be not wise in thine own eyes fear jehovah and depart from evil it will be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones. honor jehovah with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase  so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy vats shall overflow with new wine. my son despise not the chastening of jehovah neither be weary of his reproof for whom jehovah loveth he reproveth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding. for the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver and the profit thereof than fine gold.  she is more precious than rubies and none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her. length of days is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor. her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace. she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth her. jehovah by wisdom founded the earth by understanding he established the heavens. by his knowledge the depths were broken up and the skies drop down the dew. my son let them not depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck. then shalt thou walk in thy way securely and thy foot shall not stumble. when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet. be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh for jehovah will be thy confidence and will keep thy foot from being taken. withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.  say not unto thy neighbor go and come again and tomorrow i will give when thou hast it by thee. devise not evil against thy neighbor seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harm. envy thou not the man of violence and choose none of his ways. for the perverse is an abomination to jehovah but his friendship is with the upright. the curse of jehovah is in the house of the wicked but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. surely he scoffeth at the scoffers but he giveth grace unto the lowly. the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools. hear [my] sons the instruction of a father and attend to know understanding for i give you good doctrine forsake ye not my law. for i was a son unto my father tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. and he taught me and said unto me let thy heart retain my words keep my commandments and live get wisdom get understanding forget not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she will preserve thee love her and she will keep thee.  wisdom [is] the principal thing [therefore] get wisdom yea with all thy getting get understanding. exalt her and she will promote thee she will bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her. she will give to thy head a chaplet of grace a crown of beauty will she deliver to thee. hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many. i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in paths of uprightness. when thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and if thou runnest thou shalt not stumble. take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life. enter not into the path of the wicked and walk not in the way of evil men. avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass on. for they sleep not except they do evil and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall. for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. but the path of the righteous is as the dawning light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble. my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings.  let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thy heart. for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh. keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life. put away from thee a wayward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee. let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. make level the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established. turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil. my son attend unto my wisdom incline thine ear to my understanding that thou mayest preserve discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge. for the lips of a strange woman drop honey and her mouth is smoother than oil but in the end she is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two edged sword. her feet go down to death her steps take hold on sheol so that she findeth not the level path of life her ways are unstable [and] she knoweth [it] not. now therefore [my] sons hearken unto me and depart not from the words of my mouth. remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house  lest thou give thine honor unto others and thy years unto the cruel lest strangers be filled with thy strength and thy labors [be] in the house of an alien and thou mourn at thy latter end when thy flesh and thy body are consumed and say how have i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof neither have i obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me i was wellnigh in all evil in the midst of the assembly and congregation. drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well. should thy springs be dispersed abroad and streams of water in the streets let them be for thyself alone and not for strangers with thee. let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice in the wife of thy youth. [as] a loving hind and a pleasant doe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love. for why shouldest thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a foreigner for the ways of man are before the eyes of jehovah and he maketh level all his paths.  his own iniquities shall take the wicked and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin. he shall die for lack of instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. my son if thou art become surety for thy neighbor if thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. do this now my son and deliver thyself seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor go humble thyself and importune thy neighbor give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter] and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no chief overseer or ruler provideth her bread in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest. how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep [yet] a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as a robber and thy want as an armed man.  a worthless person a man of iniquity is he that walketh with a perverse mouth that winketh with his eyes that speaketh with his feet that maketh signs with his fingers in whose heart is perverseness who deviseth evil continually who soweth discord. therefore shall his calamity come suddenly on a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy. there are six things which jehovah hateth yea seven which are an abomination unto him haughty eyes a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth wicked purposes feet that are swift in running to mischief a false witness that uttereth lies and he that soweth discord among brethren. my son keep the commandment of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thy heart tie them about thy neck. when thou walkest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall watch over thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee. for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the foreigners tongue.  lust not after her beauty in thy heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids. for on account of a harlot [a man is brought] to a piece of bread and the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned or can one walk upon hot coals and his feet not be scorched so he that goeth in to his neighbors wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished. men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy himself when he is hungry but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house. he that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding he doeth it who would destroy his own soul. wounds and dishonor shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away. for jealousy is the rage of a man and he will not spare in the day of vengeance. he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts. my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee. keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye.  bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the tablet of thy heart. say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding [thy] kinswoman that they may keep thee from the strange woman from the foreigner that flattereth with her words. for at the window of my house i looked forth through my lattice and i beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house in the twilight in the evening of the day in the middle of the night and in the darkness. and behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot and wily of heart. she is clamorous and wilful her feet abide not in her house now she is in the streets now in the broad places and lieth in wait at every corner. so she caught him and kissed him [and] with an impudent face she said unto him sacrifices of peaceofferings are with me this day have i paid my vows. therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee. i have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry with striped cloths of the yarn of egypt.  i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon. come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with loves. for the man is not at home he is gone a long journey he hath taken a bag of money with him he will come home at the full moon. with her much fair speech she causeth him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forceth him along. he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool till an arrow strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his life. now therefore [my] sons hearken unto me and attend to the words of my mouth. let not thy heart decline to her ways go not astray in her paths. for she hath cast down many wounded yea all her slain are a mighty host. her house is the way to sheol going down to the chambers of death. doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice on the top of high places by the way where the paths meet she standeth beside the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors she crieth aloud  unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of men. o ye simple understand prudence and ye fools be of an understanding heart. hear for i will speak excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things. for my mouth shall utter truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing crooked or perverse in them. they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge. receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold. for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it. i wisdom have made prudence my dwelling and find out knowledge [and] discretion. the fear of jehovah is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the perverse mouth do i hate. counsel is mine and sound knowledge i am understanding i have might. by me kings reign and princes decree justice. by me princes rule and nobles [even] all the judges of the earth. i love them that love me and those that seek me diligently shall find me.  riches and honor are with me [yea] durable wealth and righteousness. my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver. i walk in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of justice that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that i may fill their treasuries. jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old. i was set up from everlasting from the beginning before the earth was. when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water. before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the beginning of the dust of the world. when he established the heavens i was there when he set a circle upon the face of the deep when he made firm the skies above when the fountains of the deep became strong when he gave to the sea its bound that the waters should not transgress his commandment when he marked out the foundations of the earth  then i was by him [as] a master workman and i was daily [his] delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in his habitable earth and my delight was with the sons of men. now therefore [my] sons hearken unto me for blessed are they that keep my ways. hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not. blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors. for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favor of jehovah. but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death. wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that is void of understanding she saith to him come eat ye of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled. leave off ye simple ones and live and walk in the way of understanding.  he that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling and he that reproveth a wicked man [getteth] himself a blot. reprove not a scoffer lest he hate thee reprove a wise man and he will love thee. give [instruction] to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning. the fear of jehovah is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased. if thou art wise thou art wise for thyself and if thou scoffest thou alone shalt bear it. the foolish woman is clamorous [she is] simple and knoweth nothing. and she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city to call to them that pass by who go right on their ways whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that is void of understanding she saith to him stolen waters are sweet and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant. but he knoweth not that the dead are there that her guests are in the depths of sheol.  the proverbs of solomon. a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death. jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. he becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. he that gathereth in summer is a wise son [but] he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. blessings are upon the head of the righteous but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. the memory of the righteous is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot. the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fall. he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool shall fall. the mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all transgressions.  in the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. the rich mans wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty. the labor of the righteous [tendeth] to life the increase of the wicked to sin. he is in the way of life that heedeth correction but he that forsaketh reproof erreth. he that hideth hatred is of lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a fool. in the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression but he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. the tongue of the righteous is [as] choice silver the heart of the wicked is little worth. the lips of the righteous feed many but the foolish die for lack of understanding. the blessing of jehovah it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow therewith. it is as sport to a fool to do wickedness and [so is] wisdom to a man of understanding. the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him and the desire of the righteous shall be granted.  when the whirlwind passeth the wicked is no more but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the sluggard to them that send him. the fear of jehovah prolongeth days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. the hope of the righteous [shall be] gladness but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.  the way of jehovah is a stronghold to the upright but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. the righteous shall never be removed but the wicked shall not dwell in the land. the mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom but the perverse tongue shall be cut off. the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked [speaketh] perverseness. a false balance is an abomination to jehovah but a just weight is his delight. when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom. the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness delivereth from death.  the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity. when a wicked man dieth [his] expectation shall perish and the hope of iniquity perisheth. the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead. with his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor but through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.  when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth and when the wicked perish there is shouting. by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. he that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. he that goeth about as a tale bearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. where no wise guidance is the people falleth but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it but he that hateth suretyship is secure.  a gracious woman obtaineth honor and violent men obtain riches. the merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. the wicked earneth deceitful wages but he that soweth righteousness [hath] a sure reward. he that is stedfast in righteousness [shall attain] unto life and he that pursueth evil [doeth it] to his own death. they that are perverse in heart are an abomination to jehovah but such as are perfect in [their] way are his delight.  [though] hand [join] in hand the evil man shall not be unpunished but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. [as] a ring of gold in a swines snout [so is] a fair woman that is without discretion. the desire of the righteous is only good [but] the expectation of the wicked is wrath. there is that scattereth and increaseth yet more and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but [it tendeth] only to want. the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. he that withholdeth grain the people shall curse him but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.  he that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor but he that searcheth after evil it shall come unto him. he that trusteth in his riches shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that is wise winneth souls. behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth how much more the wicked and the sinner whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge but he that hateth reproof is brutish. a good man shall obtain favor of jehovah but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. a man shall not be established by wickedness but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. a worthy woman is the crown of her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. the thoughts of the righteous are just [but] the counsels of the wicked are deceit. the words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. the wicked are overthrown and are not but the house of the righteous shall stand.  a man shall be commended according to his wisdom but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. better is he that is lightly esteemed and hath a servant than he that honoreth himself and lacketh bread. a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain [persons] is void of understanding. the wicked desireth the net of evil men but the root of the righteous yieldeth [fruit]. in the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man but the righteous shall come out of trouble. a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth and the doings of a mans hands shall be rendered unto him. the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel. a fools vexation is presently known but a prudent man concealeth shame. he that uttereth truth showeth forth righteousness but a false witness deceit. there is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise is health.  the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying tongue is but for a moment. deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil but to the counsellors of peace is joy. there shall no mischief happen to the righteous but the wicked shall be filled with evil. lying lips are an abomination to jehovah but they that deal truly are his delight. a prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be put under taskwork. heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop but a good word maketh it glad. the righteous is a guide to his neighbor but the way of the wicked causeth them to err. the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting but the precious substance of men [is to] the diligent. in the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof there is no death. a wise son [heareth] his fathers instruction but a scoffer heareth not rebuke. a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of the treacherous [shall eat] violence. he that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life [but] he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.  the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame. righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great wealth. the ransom of a mans life is his riches but the poor heareth no threatening. the light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. by pride cometh only contention but with the well advised is wisdom. wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall have increase. hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life. whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. the law of the wise is a fountain of life that one may depart from the snares of death. good understanding giveth favor but the way of the transgressor is hard.  every prudent man worketh with knowledge but a fool flaunteth [his] folly. a wicked messenger falleth into evil but a faithful ambassador is health. poverty and shame [shall be to] him that refuseth correction but he that regardeth reproof shall be honored. the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul but it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. walk with wise men and thou shalt be wise but the companion of fools shall smart for it. evil pursueth sinners but the righteous shall be recompensed with good. a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous. much food [is in] the tillage of the poor but there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice. he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. the righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want. every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.  he that walketh in his uprightness feareth jehovah but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. in the mouth of the foolish is a rod for [his] pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increase is by the strength of the ox. a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness uttereth lies. a scoffer seeketh wisdom and [findeth it] not but knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. go into the presence of a foolish man and thou shalt not perceive [in him] the lips of knowledge. the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit. a trespass offering mocketh fools but among the upright there is good will. the heart knoweth its own bitterness and a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tent of the upright shall flourish. there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death. even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of mirth is heaviness. the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself.  the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going. a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool beareth himself insolently and is confident. he that is soon angry will deal foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated. the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. the evil bow down before the good and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. the poor is hated even of his own neighbor but the rich hath many friends. he that despiseth his neighbor sinneth but he that hath pity on the poor happy is he. do they not err that devise evil but mercy and truth [shall be to] them that devise good. in all labor there is profit but the talk of the lips [tendeth] only to penury. the crown of the wise is their riches [but] the folly of fools is [only] folly. a true witness delivereth souls but he that uttereth lies [causeth] deceit. in the fear of jehovah is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge. the fear of jehovah is a fountain of life that one may depart from the snares of death.  in the multitude of people is the kings glory but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. he that is slow to anger is of great understanding but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. a tranquil heart is the life of the flesh but envy is the rottenness of the bones. he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker but he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him. the wicked is thrust down in his evildoing but the righteous hath a refuge in his death. wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but [that which is] in the inward part of fools is made known. righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people. the kings favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely but his wrath will be [against] him that causeth shame. a soft answer turneth away wrath but a grievous word stirreth up anger. the tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright but the mouth of fools poureth out folly. the eyes of jehovah are in every place keeping watch upon the evil and the good. a gentle tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.  a fool despiseth his fathers correction but he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence. in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish [doeth] not so. the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to jehovah but the prayer of the upright is his delight. the way of the wicked is an abomination to jehovah but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. there is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way [and] he that hateth reproof shall die. sheol and abaddon are before jehovah how much more then the hearts of the children of men a scoffer loveth not to be reproved he will not go unto the wise. a glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken. the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on folly. all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a cheerful heart [hath] a continual feast. better is little with the fear of jehovah than great treasure and trouble therewith.  better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. a wrathful man stirreth up contention but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. the way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns but the path of the upright is made a highway. a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his mother. folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom but a man of understanding maketh straight his going. where there is no counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. a man hath joy in the answer of his mouth and a word in due season how good is it to the wise the way of life [goeth] upward that he may depart from sheol beneath. jehovah will root up the house of the proud but he will establish the border of the widow. evil devices are an abomination to jehovah but pleasant words [are] pure. he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth bribes shall live. the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. jehovah is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.  the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart [and] good tidings make the bones fat. the ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life shall abide among the wise. he that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul but he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding. the fear of jehovah is the instruction of wisdom and before honor [goeth] humility. the plans of the heart belong to man but the answer of the tongue is from jehovah. all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but jehovah weigheth the spirits. commit thy works unto jehovah and thy purposes shall be established. jehovah hath made everything for its own end yea even the wicked for the day of evil. every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to jehovah [though] hand [join] in hand he shall not be unpunished. by mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for and by the fear of jehovah men depart from evil. when a mans ways please jehovah he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice. a mans heart deviseth his way but jehovah directeth his steps.  a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth shall not transgress in judgment. a just balance and scales are jehovahs all the weights of the bag are his work. it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness. righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right. the wrath of a king is [as] messengers of death but a wise man will pacify it. in the light of the kings countenance is life and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. how much better is it to get wisdom than gold yea to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. pride [goeth] before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud. he that giveth heed unto the word shall find good and whoso trusteth in jehovah happy is he. the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but the correction of fools is [their] folly. the heart of the wise instructeth his mouth and addeth learning to his lips. pleasant words are [as] a honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones. there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death. the appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him for his mouth urgeth him [thereto]. a worthless man deviseth mischief and in his lips there is as a scorching fire. a perverse man scattereth abroad strife and a whisperer separateth chief friends. a man of violence enticeth his neighbor and leadeth him in a way that is not good. he that shutteth his eyes [it is] to devise perverse things he that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. the hoary head is a crown of glory it shall be found in the way of righteousness. he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of jehovah.  better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of feasting with strife. a servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren. the refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but jehovah trieth the hearts. an evildoer giveth heed to wicked lips [and] a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue. whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker [and] he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers. excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince. a bribe is [as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth. he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends. a rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding than a hundred stripes into a fool. an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly. whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house. the beginning of strife is [as] when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before there is quarrelling. he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the righteous both of them alike are an abomination to jehovah. wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom seeing he hath no understanding a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity. a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor. he loveth transgression that loveth strife he that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction. he that hath a wayward heart findeth no good and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. he that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy. a cheerful heart is a good medicine but a broken spirit drieth up the bones. a wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom to pervert the ways of justice.  wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her that bare him. also to punish the righteous is not good [nor] to smite the noble for [their] uprightness. he that spareth his words hath knowledge and he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise when he shutteth his lips he is [esteemed as] prudent. he that separateth himself seeketh [his own] desire and rageth against all sound wisdom. a fool hath no delight in understanding but only that his heart may reveal itself. when the wicked cometh there cometh also contempt and with ignominy [cometh] reproach. the words of a mans mouth are [as] deep waters the wellspring of wisdom is [as] a flowing brook. to respect the person of the wicked is not good [nor] to turn aside the righteous in judgment. a fools lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for stripes. a fools mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul.  the words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels and they go down into the innermost parts.  he also that is slack in his work is brother to him that is a destroyer. the name of jehovah is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe. the rich mans wealth is his strong city and as a high wall in his own imagination. before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor [goeth] humility. he that giveth answer before he heareth it is folly and shame unto him. the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a broken spirit who can bear the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. a mans gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men. he that pleadeth his cause first [seemeth] just but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out. the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the mighty. a brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city and [such] contentions are like the bars of a castle. a mans belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth with the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.  death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of jehovah.  the poor useth entreaties but the rich answereth roughly. he that maketh many friends [doeth it] to his own destruction but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool. also that the soul be without knowledge is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. the foolishness of man subverteth his way and his heart fretteth against jehovah. wealth addeth many friends but the poor is separated from his friend. a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that uttereth lies shall not escape. many will entreat the favor of the liberal man and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him he pursueth [them with] words [but] they are gone. he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth understanding shall find good.  a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that uttereth lies shall perish. delicate living is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  the discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. the kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favor is as dew upon the grass. a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. house and riches are an inheritance from fathers but a prudent wife is from jehovah. slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and the idle soul shall suffer hunger. he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul [but] he that is careless of his ways shall die. he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto jehovah and his good deed will he pay him again. chasten thy son seeing there is hope nd set not thy heart on his destruction. a man of great wrath shall bear the penalty for if thou deliver [him] thou must do it yet again. hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. there are many devices in a mans heart but the counsel of jehovah that shall stand.  that which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar. the fear of jehovah [tendeth] to life and he [that hath it] shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil.  the sluggard burieth his hand in the dish and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. smite a scoffer and the simple will learn prudence and reprove one that hath understanding [and] he will understand knowledge. he that doeth violence to his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach. cease my son to hear instruction [only] to err from the words of knowledge. a worthless witness mocketh at justice and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity. judgments are prepared for scoffers and stripes for the back of fools. wine is a mocker strong drink a brawler and whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. the terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion he that provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] his own life. it is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife but every fool will be quarrelling.  the sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter therefore he shall beg in harvest and have nothing. counsel in the heart of man is [like] deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out. most men will proclaim every one his own kindness but a faithful man who can find a righteous man that walketh in his integrity blessed are his children after him. a king that sitteth on the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin diverse weights and diverse measures both of them alike are an abomination to jehovah. even a child maketh himself known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right. the hearing ear and the seeing eye jehovah hath made even both of them. love not sleep let thou come to poverty open thine eyes [and] thou shalt be satisfied with bread. it is bad it is bad saith the buyer but when he is gone his way then he boasteth. there is gold and abundance of rubies but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.  take his garment that is surety for a stranger and hold him in pledge [that is surety] for foreigners. bread of falsehood is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. every purpose is established by counsel and by wise guidance make thou war. he that goeth about as a tale bearer revealeth secrets therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips. whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. an inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed. say not thou i will recompense evil wait for jehovah and he will save thee. diverse weights are an abomination to jehovah and a false balance is not good. a mans goings are of jehovah how then can man understand his way it is a snare to a man rashly to say [it is] holy and after vows to make inquiry. a wise king winnoweth the wicked and bringeth the [threshing] wheel over them. the spirit of man is the lamp of jehovah searching all his innermost parts.  kindness and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by kindness. the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the hoary head. stripes that wound cleanse away evil and strokes [reach] the innermost parts. the kings heart is in the hand of jehovah as the watercourses he turneth it whithersoever he will. every way of a man is right in his own eyes but jehovah weigheth the hearts. to do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to jehovah than sacrifice. a high look and a proud heart [even] the lamp of the wicked is sin. the thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness but every one that is hasty [hasteth] only to want. the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death. the violence of the wicked shall sweep them away because they refuse to do justice. the way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked but as for the pure his work is right. it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a contentious woman in a wide house.  the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. when the scoffer is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge. the righteous man considereth the house of the wicked [how] the wicked are overthrown to [their] ruin. whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry but shall not be heard. a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a present in the bosom strong wrath. it is joy to the righteous to do justice but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead. he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. the wicked is a ransom for the righteous and the treacherous [cometh] in the stead of the upright. it is better to dwell in a desert land than with a contentious and fretful woman. there is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man swalloweth it up. he that followeth after righteousness and kindness findeth life righteousness and honor.  a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. the proud and haughty man scoffer is his name he worketh in the arrogance of pride. the desire of the sluggard killeth him for his hands refuse to labor. there is that coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind a false witness shall perish but the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure. a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright he establisheth his ways. there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against jehovah. the horse is prepared against the day of battle but victory is of jehovah. a [good] name is rather to be chosen than great riches [and] loving favor rather than silver and gold. the rich and the poor meet together jehovah is the maker of them all.  a prudent man seeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and suffer for it. the reward of humility [and] the fear of jehovah [is] riches and honor and life. thorns [and] snares are in the way of the perverse he that keepeth his soul shall be far from them. train up a child in the way he should go and even when he is old he will not depart from it. the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender. he that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity and the rod of his wrath shall fail. he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of his bread to the poor. cast out the scoffer and contention will go out yea strife and ignominy will cease. he that loveth pureness of heart [for] the grace of his lips the king will be his friend. the eyes of jehovah preserve [him that hath] knowledge but he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man. the sluggard saith there is a lion without i shall be slain in the streets. the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of jehovah shall fall therein.  foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child [but] the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. he that oppresseth the poor to increase his [gain] [and] he that giveth to the rich [shall come] only to want. incline thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thy heart unto my knowledge. for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee if they be established together upon thy lips. that thy trust may be in jehovah i have made [them] known to thee this day even to thee. have not i written unto thee excellent things of counsels and knowledge to make thee know the certainty of the words of truth that thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate for jehovah will plead their cause and despoil of life those that despoil them. make no friendship with a man that is given to anger and with a wrathful man thou shalt not go lest thou learn this ways and get a snare to thy soul. be thou not one of them that strike hands [or] of them that are sureties for debts.  if thou hast not wherewith to pay why should he take away thy bed from under thee remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set. seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men. when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently him that is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite. be not desirous of his dainties seeing they are deceitful food. weary not thyself to be rich cease from thine own wisdom. wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for [riches] certainly make themselves wings like an eagle that flieth toward heaven. eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainties for as he thinketh within himself so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee. the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose thy sweet words. speak not in the hearing of a fool for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. remove not the ancient landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless for their redeemer is strong he will plead their cause against thee.  apply thy heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge. withhold not correction from the child [for] if thou beat him with the rod he will not die. thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from sheol. my son if thy heart be wise my heart will be glad even mine yea my heart will rejoice when thy lips speak right things. let not thy heart envy sinners but [be thou] in the fear of jehovah all the day long for surely there is a reward and thy hope shall not be cut off. hear thou my son and be wise and guide thy heart in the way. be not among winebibbers among gluttonous eaters of flesh for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags. hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old. buy the truth and sell it not [yea] wisdom and instruction and understanding. the father of the righteous will greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him. let thy father and thy mother be glad and let her that bare thee rejoice. my son give me thy heart and let thine eyes delight in my ways.  for a harlot is a deep ditch and a foreign woman is a narrow pit. yea she lieth in wait as a robber and increaseth the treacherous among men. who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath complaining who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek out mixed wine. look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it sparkleth in the cup when it goeth down smoothly at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. thine eyes shall behold strange things and thy heart shall utter perverse things. yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. they have stricken me [shalt thou say] and i was not hurt they have beaten me and i felt it not when shall i awake i will seek it yet again. be not thou envious against evil men neither desire to be with them for their heart studieth oppression and their lips talk of mischief. through wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established  and by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant riches. a wise man is strong yea a man of knowledge increaseth might for by wise guidance thou shalt make thy war and in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not his mouth in the gate. he that deviseth to do evil men shall call him a mischiefmaker. the thought of foolishness is sin and the scoffer is an abomination to men. if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small. deliver them that are carried away unto death and those that are ready to be slain see that thou hold back. if thou sayest behold we knew not this doth not he that weigheth the hearts consider it and he that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it and shall not he render to every man according to his work my son eat thou honey for it is good and the droppings of the honeycomb which are sweet to thy taste so shalt thou know wisdom to be unto thy soul if thou hast found it then shall there be a reward and thy hope shall not be cut off.  lay not wait o wicked man against the habitation of the righteous destroy not his restingplace for a righteous man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked are overthrown by calamity. rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thy heart be glad when he is overthrown lest jehovah see it and it displease him and he turn away his wrath from him. fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be thou envious at the wicked for there shall be no reward to the evil man the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. my son fear thou jehovah and the king [and] company not with them that are given to change for their calamity shall rise suddenly and the destruction from them both who knoweth it these also are [sayings] of the wise. to have respect of persons in judgment is not good. he that saith unto the wicked thou art righteous peoples shall curse him nations shall abhor him but to them that rebuke [him] shall be delight and a good blessing shall come upon them. he kisseth the lips who giveth a right answer.  prepare thy work without and make it ready for thee in the field and afterwards build thy house. be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause and deceive not with thy lips. say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i will render to the man according to his work. i went by the field of the sluggard and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns the face thereof was covered with nettles and the stone wall thereof was broken down. then i beheld and considered well i saw and received instruction [yet] a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as a robber and thy want as an armed man. these also are proverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiah king of judah copied out. it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. as the heavens for height and the earth for depth so the heart of kings is unsearchable. take away the dross from the silver and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner  take away the wicked [from] before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness. put not thyself forward in the presence of the king and stand not in the place of great men for better is it that it be said unto thee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. go not forth hastily to strive lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame. debate thy cause with thy neighbor [himself] and disclose not the secret of another lest he that heareth it revile thee and thine infamy turn not away. a word fitly spoken is [like] apples of gold in network of silver. [as] an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. as the cold of snow in the time of harvest [so is] a faithful messenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of his masters. [as] clouds and wind without rain [so is] he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely. by long forbearing is a ruler persuaded and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.  hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it. let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbors house lest he be weary of thee and hate thee. a man that beareth false witness against his neighbor is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrow. confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is [like] a broken tooth and a foot out of joint. [as] one that taketh off a garment in cold weather [and as] vinegar upon soda so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart. if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink for thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head and jehovah will reward thee. the north wind bringeth forth rain so doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance. it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a contentious woman in a wide house. [as] cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country. [as] a troubled fountain and a corrupted spring [so is] a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.  it is not good to eat much honey so [for men] to search out their own glory is grievous.  he whose spirit is without restraint is [like] a city that is broken down and without walls. as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honor is not seemly for a fool. as the sparrow in her wandering as the swallow in her flying so the curse that is causeless alighteth not. a whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the back of fools. answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him. answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit. he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off [his own] feet [and] drinketh in damage. the legs of the lame hang loose so is a parable in the mouth of fools. as one that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth honor to a fool. [as] a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouth of fools. [as] an archer that woundeth all so is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by. as a dog that returneth to his vomit [so is] a fool that repeateth his folly.  seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him. the sluggard saith there is a lion in the way a lion is in the streets.  [as] the door turneth upon its hinges so doth the sluggard upon his bed. the sluggard burieth his hand in the dish it wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth. the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. he that passeth by [and] vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him is [like] one that taketh a dog by the ears. as a madman who casteth firebrands arrows and death so is the man that deceiveth his neighbor and saith am not i in sport for lack of wood the fire goeth out and where there is no whisperer contention ceaseth. [as] coals are to hot embers and wood to fire so is a contentious man to inflame strife. the words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels and they go down into the innermost parts. fervent lips and a wicked heart are [like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross. he that hateth dissembleth with his lips but he layeth up deceit within him  when he speaketh fair believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart though [his] hatred cover itself with guile his wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly.  whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it shall return upon him. a lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips. a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools vexation is heavier than they both. wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming but who is able to stand before jealousy better is open rebuke than love that is hidden. faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are profuse. the full soul loatheth a honeycomb but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from his place. oil and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of a mans friend [that cometh] of hearty counsel.  thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not and go not to thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him that reproacheth me. a prudent man seeth the evil [and] hideth himself [but] the simple pass on [and] suffer for it. take his garment that is surety for a stranger and hold him in pledge [that is surety] for a foreign woman. he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early in the morning it shall be counted a curse to him. a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike he that would restrain her restraineth the wind and his right hand encountereth oil. iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. whoso keepeth the figtree shall eat the fruit thereof and he that regardeth his master shall be honored. as in water face [answereth] to face so the heart of man to man. sheol and abaddon are never satisfied and the eyes of man are never satisfied. the refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold and a man is [tried] by his praise.  though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain yet will not his foolishness depart from him. be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks [and] look well to thy herds for riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure unto all generations the hay is carried and the tender grass showeth itself and the herbs of the mountains are gathered in. the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of the field and [there will be] goats milk enough for thy food for the food of thy household and maintenance for thy maidens. the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion. for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by men of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged. a needy man that oppresseth the poor is [like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them. evil men understand not justice but they that seek jehovah understand all things.  better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in [his] ways though he be rich. whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father. he that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer is an abomination. whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way he shall fall himself into his own pit but the perfect shall inherit good. the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. when the righteous triumph there is great glory but when the wicked rise men hide themselves. he that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. [as] a roaring lion and a ranging bear [so is] a wicked ruler over a poor people.  the prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor [but] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. a man that is laden with the blood of any person shall flee unto the pit let no man stay him. whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered but he that is perverse in [his] ways shall fall at once. he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough. a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. to have respect of persons is not good neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. he that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches and knoweth not that want shall come upon him. he that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor than he that flattereth with the tongue. whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer. he that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife but he that putteth his trust in jehovah shall be made fat. he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered.  he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase. he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy. when the righteous are increased the people rejoice but when a wicked man beareth rule the people sigh. whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth [his] substance. the king by justice establisheth the land but he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. a man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his steps. in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. the righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor the wicked hath not understanding to know [it]. scoffers set a city in a flame but wise men turn away wrath. if a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man whether he be angry or laugh there will be no rest. the bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect and as for the upright they seek his life.  a fool uttereth all his anger but a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it. if a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood all his servants are wicked. the poor man and the oppressor meet together jehovah lighteneth the eyes of them both. the king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for ever. the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. when the wicked are increased transgression increaseth but the righteous shall look upon their fall. correct thy son and he will give thee rest yea he will give delight unto thy soul. where there is no vision the people cast off restraint but he that keepeth the law happy is he. a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not give heed. seest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of him. he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become a son at the last. an angry man stirreth up strife and a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.  a mans pride shall bring him low but he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor. whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in jehovah shall be safe. many seek the rulers favor but a mans judgment [cometh] from jehovah. an unjust man is an abomination to the righteous and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked. the words of agur the son of jakeh the oracle. the man saith unto ithiel unto ithiel and ucal surely i am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man and i have not learned wisdom neither have i the knowledge of the holy one. who hath ascended up into heaven and descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in his garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his sons name if thou knowest every word of god is tried he is a shield unto them that take refuge in him. add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar.  two things have i asked of thee deny me [them] not before i die remove far from me falsehood and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with the food that is needful for me lest i be full and deny [thee] and say who is jehovah or lest i be poor and steal and use profanely the name of my god. slander not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be held guilty. there is a generation that curse their father and bless not their mother. there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and [yet] are not washed from their filthiness. there is a generation oh how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up. there is a generation whose teeth are [as] swords and their jaw teeth [as] knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men. the horseleach hath two daughters [crying] give give. there are three things that are never satisfied [yea] four that say not enough sheol and the barren womb the earth that is not satisfied with water and the fire that saith not enough.  the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it. there are three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maiden. so is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness. for three things the earth doth tremble and for four [which] it cannot bear for a servant when he is king and a fool when he is filled with food for an odious woman when she is married and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. there are four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise the ants are a people not strong yet they provide their food in the summer the conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks the locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bands the lizard taketh hold with her hands yet is she in kings palaces.  there are three things which are stately in their march yea four which are stately in going the lion which is mightiest among beasts and turneth not away for any the greyhound the hegoat also and the king against whom there is no rising up. if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil [lay] thy hand upon thy mouth. for the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. the words of king lemuel the oracle which his mother taught him. what my son and what o son of my womb and what o son of my vows give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes [to say] where is strong drink lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the justice [due] to any that is afflicted. give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more. open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are left desolate.  open thy mouth judge righteously and minister justice to the poor and needy. a worthy woman who can find for her price is far above rubies. the heart of her husband trusteth in her and he shall have no lack of gain. she doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands. she is like the merchantships she bringeth her bread from afar. she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth food to her household and their task to her maidens. she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. she girdeth her loins with strength and maketh strong her arms. she perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable her lamp goeth not out by night. she layeth her hands to the distaff and her hands hold the spindle. she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet. she maketh for herself carpets of tapestry her clothing is fine linen and purple.  her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land. she maketh linen garments and selleth them and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. strength and dignity are her clothing and she laugheth at the time to come. she openeth her mouth with wisdom and the law of kindness is on her tongue. she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness. her children rise up and call her blessed her husband [also] and he praiseth her [saying] many daughters have done worthily but thou excellest them all. grace is deceitful and beauty is vain [but] a woman that feareth jehovah she shall be praised. give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her in the gates. the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem. vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity. what profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun one generation goeth and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever. the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.  the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it turneth about continually in its course and the wind returneth again to its circuits. all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place whither the rivers go thither they go again. all things are full of weariness man cannot utter [it] the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing. that which hath been is that which shall be and that which hath been done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun. is there a thing whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been long ago in the ages which were before us. there is no remembrance of the former [generations] neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter [generations] that are to come among those that shall come after. i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem. and i applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven it is a sore travail that god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.  i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and a striving after wind. that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. i communed with mine own hear saying lo i have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in jerusalem yea my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. and i applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also was a striving after wind. for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. i said in my heart come now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also was vanity. i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it i searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine my heart yet guiding [me] with wisdom and how to lay hold on folly till i might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life. i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards  i made me gardens and parks and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit i made me pools of water to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared i bought men servants and maidservants and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of herds and flocks above all that were before me in jerusalem i gathered me also silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me mensingers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men musical instruments and that of all sorts. so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me. and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor and this was my portion from all my labor. then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and a striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.  and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king [even] that which hath been done long ago. then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness. the wise mans eyes are in his head and the fool walketh in darkness and yet i perceived that one event happeneth to them all. then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me and why was i then more wise then said i in my heart that this also is vanity. for of the wise man even as of the fool there is no remembrance for ever seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. and how doth the wise man die even as the fool so i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me for all is vanity and a striving after wind. and i hated all my labor wherein i labored under the sun seeing that i must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  and who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein i have labored and wherein i have showed myself wise under the sun. this also is vanity. therefore i turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein i had labored under the sun.  for there is a man whose labor is with wisdom and with knowledge and with skilfulness yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. this also is vanity and a great evil. for what hath a man of all his labor and of the striving of his heart wherein he laboreth under the sun for all his days are [but] sorrows and his travail is grief yea even in the night his heart taketh no rest. this also is vanity. there is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. this also i saw that it is from the hand of god. for who can eat or who can have enjoyment more than i  for to the man that pleaseth him [god] giveth wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that pleaseth god. this also is vanity and a striving after wind. for everything there is a season and a time for very purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance  a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace. what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.  he hath made everything beautiful in its time also he hath set eternity in their heart yet so that man cannot find out the work that god hath done from the beginning even to the end. i know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good so long as they live. and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy good in all his labor is the gift of god. i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god hath done it that men should fear before him. that which is hath been long ago and that which is to be hath long ago been and god seeketh again that which is passed away.  and moreover i saw under the sun in the place of justice that wickedness was there and in the place of righteousness that wickedness was there. i said in my heart god will judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. i said in my heart [it is] because of the sons of men that god may prove them and that they may see that they themselves are [but as] beasts.  for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath and man hath no preeminence above the beasts for all is vanity. all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again. who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth wherefore i saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works for that is his portion for who shall bring him [back] to see what shall be after him then i returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter. wherefore i praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive yea better than them both [did i esteem] him that hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. then i saw all labor and every skilful work that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. this also is vanity and a striving after wind.  the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh. better is a handful with quietness than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind. then i returned and saw vanity under the sun. there is one that is alone and he hath not a second yea he hath neither son nor brother yet is there no end of all his labor neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. for whom then [saith he] do i labor and deprive my soul of good this also is vanity yea it is a sore travail. two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor. for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth and hath not another to lift him up. again if two lie together then they have warmth but how can one be warm [alone] and if a man prevail against him that is alone two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. for out of prison he came forth to be king yea even in his kingdom he was born poor.  i saw all the living that walk under the sun that they were with the youth the second that stood up in his stead. there was no end of all the people even of all them over whom he was yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind. keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools for they know not that they do evil. be not rash with thy mouth and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few. for a dream cometh with a multitude of business and a fools voice with a multitude of words. when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou vowest. better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that is was an error wherefore should god be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thy hands  for in the multitude of dreams there are vanities and in many words but fear thou god. if thou seest the oppression of the poor and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province marvel not at the matter for one higher than the high regardeth and there are higher than they. moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king [himself] is served by the field. he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this also is vanity. when goods increase they are increased that eat them and what advantage is there to the owner thereof save the beholding [of them] with his eyes the sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. there is a grievous evil which i have seen under the sun [namely] riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt and those riches perish by evil adventure and if he hath begotten a son there is nothing in his hand.  as he came forth from his mothers womb naked shall he go again as he came and shall take nothing for his labor which he may carry away in his hand. and this also is a grievous evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind all his days also he eateth in darkness and he is sore vexed and hath sickness and wrath. behold that which i have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy good in all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun all the days of his life which god hath given him for this is his portion. every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his laborthis is the gift of god. for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god answereth [him] in the joy of his heart. there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is heavy upon men  a man to whom god giveth riches wealth and honor so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but an alien eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease. if a man beget a hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years are many but his soul be not filled with good and moreover he have no burial i say that an untimely birth is better than he for it cometh in vanity and departeth in darkness and the name thereof is covered with darkness moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it this hath rest rather than the other yea though he live a thousand years twice told and yet enjoy no good do not all go to one place all the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled. for what advantage hath the wise more than the fool [or] what hath the poor man that knoweth how to walk before the living better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this also is vanity and a striving after wind. whatsoever hath been the name thereof was given long ago and it is know what man is neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.  seeing there are many things that increase vanity what is man the better for who knoweth what is good for man in [his] life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun a [good] name is better than precious oil and the day of death than the day of ones birth. it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart. sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad. the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools. for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity. surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish and a bribe destroyeth the understanding. better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof [and] the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.  say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. wisdom is as good as an inheritance yea more excellent is it for them that see the sun. for wisdom is a defence even as money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked in the day of prosperity be joyful and in the day of adversity consider yea god hath made the one side by side with the other to the end that man should not find out anything [that shall be] after him. all this have i seen in my days of vanity there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth [his life] in his evil doing. be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself overwise why shouldest thou destroy thyself be not overmuch wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time  it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from that withdraw not thy hand for he that feareth god shall come forth from them all. wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city. surely there is not a righteous man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not. also take not heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. all this have i proved in wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me. that which is is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out i turned about and my heart [was set] to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the reason [of things] and to know that wickedness is folly and that foolishness is madness. and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets [and] whose hands are bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her. behold this have i found saith the preacher [laying] one thing to another to find out the account  which my soul still seeketh but i have not found one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found. behold this only have i found that god made man upright but they have sought out many inventions. who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the hardness of his face is changed. i [counsel thee] keep the kings command and that in regard of the oath of god. be not hasty to go out of his presence persist not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. for the kings word [hath] power and who may say unto him what doest thou whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth time and judgment for to every purpose there is a time and judgment because the misery of man is great upon him for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him how it shall be there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power over the day of death and there is no discharge in war neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.  all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun [there is] a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt. so i saw the wicked buried and they came [to the grave] and they that had done right went away from the holy place and were forgotten in the city this also is vanity. because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. though a sinner do evil a hundred times and prolong his [days] yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god that fear before him but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong [his] days [which are] as a shadow because he feareth not before god. there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous i said that this also is vanity.  then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be joyful for that shall abide with him in his labor [all] the days of his life which god hath given him under the sun. when i applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes then i beheld all the work of god that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because however much a man labor to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea moreover though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it. for all this i laid to my heart even to explore all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of god whether it be love or hatred man knoweth it not all is before them. all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner [and] he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath.  this is an evil in all that is done under the sun that there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that [they go] to the dead. for to him that is joined with all the living there is hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion. for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten. as well their love as their hatred and their envy is perished long ago neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun. go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god hath already accepted thy works. let thy garments be always white and let not thy head lack oil. live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all thy days of vanity for that is thy portion in life and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun. whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do [it] with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in sheol whither thou goest.  i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all. for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them. i have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise and it seemed great unto me there was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it. now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man. then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heard. the words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth much good.  dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor [so] doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. a wise mans heart is at his right hand but a fools heart at his left. yea also when the fool walketh by the way his understanding faileth him and he saith to every one [that] he is a fool. if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for gentleness allayeth great offences. there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler folly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in a low place. i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking like servants upon the earth. he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh through a wall a serpent shall bite him. whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith [and] he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. if the iron be blunt and one do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct. if the serpent bite before it is charmed then is there no advantage in the charmer.  the words of a wise mans mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. a fool also multiplieth words [yet] man knoweth not what shall be and that which shall be after him who can tell him the labor of fools wearieth every one of them for he knoweth not how to go to the city. woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princes eat in the morning happy art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness by slothfulness the roof sinketh in and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh glad the life and money answereth all things. revile not the king no not in thy thought and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days. give a portion to seven yea even unto eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.  if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if a tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there shall it be. he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. as thou knowest not what is the way of the wind [nor] how the bones [do grow] in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the work of god who doeth all. in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thy hand for thou knowest not which shall prosper whether this or that or whether they both shall be alike good. truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. yea if a man live many years let him rejoice in them all but let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many. all that cometh is vanity. rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment.  therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for youth and the dawn of life are vanity. remember also thy creator in the days of thy youth before the evil days come and the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened and the doors shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grinding is low and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird and all the daughters of music shall be brought low yea they shall be afraid of [that which is] high and terrors [shall be] in the way and the almond tree shall blossom and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his everlasting home and the mourners go about the streets before the silver cord is loosed or the golden bowl is broken or the pitcher is broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern  and the dust returneth to the earth as it was and the spirit returneth unto god who gave it. vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity. and further because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he pondered and sought out [and] set in order many proverbs. the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written uprightly [even] words of truth. the words of the wise are as goads and as nails well fastened are [the words of] the masters of assemblies [which] are given from one shepherd. and furthermore my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh. [this is] the end of the matter all hath been heard fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole [duty] of man. for god will bring every work into judgment with every hidden thing whether it be good or whether it be evil. the song of songs which is solomons. let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine. thine oils have a goodly fragrance thy name is [as] oil poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee.  draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will make mention of thy love more than of wine rightly do they love thee. i am black but comely oh ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon. look not upon me because i am swarthy because the sun hath scorched me. my mothers sons were incensed against me they made me keeper of the vineyards [but] mine own vineyard have i not kept. tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest [thy flock] where thou makest [it] to rest at noon for why should i be as one that is veiled beside the flocks of thy companions if thou know not o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents. i have compared thee o my love to a steed in pharaohs chariots. thy cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair] thy neck with strings of jewels. we will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver. while the king sat at his table my spikenard sent forth its fragrance.  my beloved is unto me [as] a bundle of myrrh that lieth betwixt my breasts. my beloved is unto me [as] a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of en gedi. behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thine eyes are [as] doves. behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our couch is green. the beams of our house are cedars [and] our rafters are firs. i am a rose of sharon a lily of the valleys. as a lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters. as the appletree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons. i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste. he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love. stay ye me with raisins refresh me with apples for i am sick from love. his left hand [is] under my head and his right hand doth embrace me. i adjure you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes or by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake [my] love until he please. the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills.  my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh in at the windows he glanceth through the lattice. my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away. for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing [of birds] is come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land the figtree ripeneth her green figs and the vines are in blossom they give forth their fragrance. arise my love my fair one and come away. o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the covert of the steep place let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely. take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vineyards for our vineyards are in blossom. my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth [his flock] among the lilies. until the day be cool and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether. by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not.  [i said] i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not. the watchmen that go about the city found me [to whom i said] saw ye him whom my soul loveth it was but a little that i passed from them when i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mothers house and into the chamber of her that conceived me. i adjure you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes or by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake [my] love until he please. who is this that cometh up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant behold it is the litter of solomon threescore mighty men are about it of the mighty men of israel. they all handle the sword [and] are expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night. king solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of lebanon.  he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the seat of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with love from the daughters of jerusalem. go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart. behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thine eyes are [as] doves behind thy veil. thy hair is as a flock of goats that lie along the side of mount gilead. thy teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn which are come up from the washing whereof every one hath twins and none is bereaved among them. thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy mouth is comely. thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil. thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armory whereon there hang a thousand bucklers all the shields of the mighty men. thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe which feed among the lilies.  until the day be cool and the shadows flee away i will get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense. thou art all fair my love and there is no spot in thee. come with me from lebanon [my] bride with me from lebanon look from the top of amana from the top of senir and hermon from the lions dens from the mountains of the leopards. thou hast ravished my heart my sister [my] bride thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck. how fair is thy love my sister [my] bride how much better is thy love than wine and the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices thy lips o [my] bride drop [as] the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon. a garden shut up is my sister [my] bride a spring shut up a fountain sealed. thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits henna with spikenard plants spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices.  [thou art] a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and flowing streams from lebanon. awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out. let my beloved come into his garden and eat his precious fruits. i am come into my garden my sister [my] bride i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have drunk my wine with my milk. eat o friends drink yea drink abundantly o beloved. i was asleep but my heart waked it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh [saying] open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with dew my locks with the drops of the night. i have put off my garment how shall i put it on i have washed my feet how shall i defile them my beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door] and my heart was moved for him. i rose up to open to my beloved and my hands droppeth with myrrh and my fingers with liquid myrrh upon the handles of the bolt.  i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself [and] was gone. my soul had failed me when he spake i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer. the watchmen that go about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me. i adjure you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that i am sick from love. what is thy beloved more than [another] beloved o thou fairest among women what is thy beloved more than [another] beloved that thou dost so adjure us my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest among ten thousand. his head is [as] the most fine gold his locks are bushy [and] black as a raven. his eyes are like doves beside the waterbrooks washed with milk [and] fitly set. his cheeks are as a bed of spices [as] banks of sweet herbs his lips are [as] lilies dropping liquid myrrh. his hands are [as] rings of gold set with beryl his body is [as] ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.  his legs are [as] pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold his aspect is like lebanon excellent as the cedars. his mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely. this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem. whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women whither hath thy beloved turned him that we may seek him with thee my beloved is gone down to his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies. i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine he feedeth [his flock] among the lilies thou art fair o my love as tirzah comely as jerusalem terrible as an army with banners. turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me. thy hair is as a flock of goats that lie along the side of gilead. thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing whereof every one hath twins and none is bereaved among them. thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil. there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without number.  my dove my undefiled is [but] one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bare her. the daughters saw her and called her blessed [yea] the queens and the concubines and they praised her. who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun terrible as an army with banners i went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley to see whether the vine budded [and] the pomegranates were in flower. before i was aware my soul set me [among] the chariots of my princely people. return return o shulammite return return that we may look upon thee. why will ye look upon the shulammite as upon the dance of mahanaim how beautiful are thy feet in sandals o princes daughter thy rounded thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a skilful workman. thy body is [like] a round goblet [wherein] no mingled wine is wanting thy waist is [like] a heap of wheat set about with lilies. thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.  thy neck is like the tower of ivory thine eyes [as] the pools in heshbon by the gate of bath rabbim thy nose is like the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus. thy head upon thee is like carmel and the hair of thy head like purple the king is held captive in the tresses [thereof]. how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights this thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to its clusters. i said i will climb up into the palm tree i will take hold of the branches thereof let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy breath like apples and thy mouth like the best wine that goeth down smoothly for my beloved gliding through the lips of those that are asleep. i am my beloveds and his desire is toward me. come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in the villages. let us get up early to the vineyards let us see whether the vine hath budded [and] its blossom is open [and] the pomegranates are in flower there will i give thee my love.  the mandrakes give forth fragrance and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits new and old which i have laid up for thee o my beloved. oh that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother [when] i should find thee without i would kiss thee yea and none would despise me. i would lead thee [and] bring thee into my mothers house who would instruct me i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. his left hand [should be] under my head and his right hand should embrace me. i adjure you o daughters of jerusalem that ye stir not up nor awake [my] love until he please. who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved under the appletree i awakened thee there thy mother was in travail with thee there was she in travail that brought thee forth. set me as a seal upon thy heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as sheol the flashes thereof are flashes of fire a very flame of jehovah. many waters cannot quench love neither can floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love he would utterly be contemned.  we have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for if she be a wall we will build upon her a turret of silver and if she be a door we will inclose her with boards of cedar. i am a wall and my breasts like the towers [thereof] then was i in his eyes as one that found peace. solomon had a vineyard at baal hamon he let out the vineyard unto keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver. my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon shalt have the thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken for thy voice cause me to hear it. make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah. hear o heavens and give ear o earth for jehovah hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me.  the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib [but] israel doth not know my people doth not consider. ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that deal corruptly they have forsaken jehovah they have despised the holy one of israel they are estranged [and gone] backward. why will ye be still stricken that ye revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint. from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it [but] wounds and bruises and fresh stripes they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with oil. your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers. and the daughter of zion is left as a booth in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city. except jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom we should have been like unto gomorrah. hear the word of jehovah ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah.  what unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices saith jehovah i have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of hegoats. when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to trample my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me new moon and sabbath the calling of assemblies i cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting. your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary of bearing them. and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood. wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek justice relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow. come now and let us reason together saith jehovah though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool. if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land  but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it. how is the faithful city become a harlot she that was full of justice righteousness lodged in her but now murderers. thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water. thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth bribes and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. therefore saith the lord jehovah of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies and i will turn my hand upon thee and thoroughly purge away thy dross and will take away all thy tin and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness a faithful town. zion shall be redeemed with justice and her converts with righteousness. but the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together and they that forsake jehovah shall be consumed.  for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water. and the strong shall be as tow and his work as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them. the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem. and it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of jehovahs house shall be established on the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it. and many peoples shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of jehovah to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of jehovah from jerusalem. and he will judge between the nations and will decide concerning many peoples and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more.  o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of jehovah. for thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they are filled [with customs] from the east and [are] soothsayers like the philistines and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.  and their land is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land also is full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots. their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made. and the mean man is bowed down and the great man is brought low therefore forgive them not. enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust from before the terror of jehovah and from the glory of his majesty. the lofty looks of man shall be brought low and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. for there shall be a day of jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty and upon all that is lifted up and it shall be brought low and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan  and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up and upon every lofty tower and upon every fortified wall and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant imagery.  and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. and the idols shall utterly pass away. and men shall go into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth from before the terror of jehovah and from the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth. in that day men shall cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold which have been made for them to worship to the moles and to the bats to go into the caverns of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks from before the terror of jehovah and from the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth. cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of for behold the lord jehovah of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah stay and staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water  the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the diviner and the elder the captain of fifty and the honorable man and the counsellor and the expert artificer and the skilful enchanter.  and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them. and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbor the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man and the base against the honorable. when a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father [saying] thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand in that day shall he lift up [his voice] saying i will not be a healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing ye shall not make me ruler of the people. for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against jehovah to provoke the eyes of his glory. the show of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not. woe unto their soul for they have done evil unto themselves.  say ye of the righteous that [it shall be] well [with him] for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. woe unto the wicked [it shall be] ill [with him] for what his hands have done shall be done unto him. as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them. o my people they that lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths.  jehovah standeth up to contend and standeth to judge the peoples. jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and the princes thereof it is ye that have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses what mean ye that ye crush my people and grind the face of the poor saith the lord jehovah of hosts. moreover jehovah said because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.  in that day the lord will take away the beauty of their anklets and the cauls and the crescents the pendants and the bracelets and the mufflers the headtires and the ankle chains and the sashes and the perfumeboxes and the amulets the rings and the nosejewels the festival robes and the mantles and the shawls and the satchels the handmirrors and the fine linen and the turbans and the veils. and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness and instead of a girdle a rope and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a robe a girding of sackcloth branding instead of beauty. thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. and her gates shall lament and mourn and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground. and seven women shall take hold of one man in that day saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name take thou away our reproach. in that day shall the branch of jehovah be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel.  and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of justice and by the spirit of burning. and jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount zion and over her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory [shall be spread] a covering. and there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day time from the heat and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain. let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. my wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he digged it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also hewed out a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes.  and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard. what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up i will break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor hoed but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. for the vineyard of jehovah of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for justice but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry. woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no room and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land in mine ears [saith] jehovah of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant. for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.  woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that tarry late into the night till wine inflame them and the harp and the lute the tabret and the pipe and wine are [in] their feasts but they regard not the work of jehovah neither have they considered the operation of his hands. therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge and their honorable men are famished and their multitude are parched with thirst. therefore sheol hath enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth among them descend [into it]. and the mean man is bowed down and the great man is humbled and the eyes of the lofty are humbled but jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice and god the holy one is sanctified in righteousness. then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat. woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood and sin as it were with a cart rope  that say let him make speed let him hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink that justify the wicked for a bribe and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have rejected the law of jehovah of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel. therefore is the anger of jehovah kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the mountains tremble and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still.  and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss for them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly. none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be accounted as flint and their wheels as a whirlwind their roaring shall be like a lioness they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and carry it away safe and there shall be none to deliver. and they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness [and] distress and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof. in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. above him stood the seraphim each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly. and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is jehovah of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory.  and the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke. then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king jehovah of hosts. then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he touched my mouth with it and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin forgiven. and i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then i said here am i send me. and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not. make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they sea with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn again and be healed. then said i lord how long and he answered until cities be waste without inhabitant and houses without man and the land become utterly waste  and jehovah have removed men far away and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. and if there be yet a tenth in it it also shall in turn be eaten up as a terebinth and as an oak whose stock remaineth when they are felled so the holy seed is the stock thereof. and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up to jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it. and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim. and his heart trembled and the heart of his people as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind. then said jehovah unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither let thy heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin and syria and of the son of remaliah. because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have purposed evil against thee saying  let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set up a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeel thus saith the lord jehovah it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass. for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken in pieces so that is shall not be a people and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son. if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established. and jehovah spake again unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of jehovah thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above. but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt jehovah. and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men that ye will weary my god also therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel. butter and honey shall he eat when he knoweth to refuse the evil and choose the good. for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.  jehovah will bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy fathers house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah[even] the king of assyria. and it shall come to pass in that day that jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria. and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the clefts of the rocks and upon all thornhedges and upon all pastures. in that day will the lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the river [even] with the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard. and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep and it shall come to pass that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land. and it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings shall be for briers and thorns.  with arrows and with bow shall one come thither because all the land shall be briers and thorns. and all the hills that were digged with the mattock thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of sheep. and jehovah said unto me take thee a great tablet and write upon it with the pen of a man for mahershalal hashbaz and i will take unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah. and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son. then said jehovah unto me call his name maher shalalhashbaz. for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be carried away before the king of assyria. and jehovah spake unto me yet again saying forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliahs son  now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many [even] the king of assyria and all his glory and it shall come up over all its channels and go over all its banks and it shall sweep onward into judah it shall overflow and pass through it shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel. make an uproar o ye peoples and be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and be broken in pieces gird yourselves and be broken in pieces. take counsel together and it shall be brought to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us. for jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people saying say ye not a conspiracy concerning all whereof this people shall say a conspiracy neither fear ye their fear nor be in dread [thereof]. jehovah of hosts him shall ye sanctify and let him be your fear and let him be your dread.  and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem. and many shall stumble thereon and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken. bind thou up the testimony seal the law among my disciples. and i will wait for jehovah that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him. behold i and the children whom jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from jehovah of hosts who dwelleth in mount zion. and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards that chirp and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god on behalf of the living [should they seek] unto the dead to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word surely there is no morning for them. and they shall pass through it sore distressed and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse by their king and by their god and turn their faces upward  and they shall look unto the earth and behold distress and darkness the gloom of anguish and into thick darkness [they shall be] driven away. but there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. in the former time he brought into contempt the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali but in the latter time hath he made it glorious by the way of the sea beyond the jordan galilee of the nations. the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined. thou hast multiplied the nation thou hast increased their joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. for the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor thou hast broken as in the day of midian. for all the armor of the armed man in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood shall be for burning for fuel of fire. for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace.  of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. the zeal of jehovah of hosts will perform this. the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel. and all the people shall know [even] ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria that say in pride and in stoutness of heart the bricks are fallen but we will build with hewn stone the sycomores are cut down but we will put cedars in their place. therefore jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of rezin and will stir up his enemies the syrians before and the philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth. for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still. yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them neither have they sought jehovah of hosts. therefore jehovah will cut off from israel head and tail palmbranch and rush in one day. the elder and the honorable man he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tail.  for they that lead this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyed. therefore the lord will not rejoice over their young men neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows for every one is profane and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly. for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still.  for wickedness burneth as the fire it devoureth the briers and thorns yea it kindleth in the thickets of the forest and they roll upward in a column of smoke. through the wrath of jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up and the people are as the fuel of fire no man spareth his brother. and one shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm manasseh ephraim and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah. for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still. woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and to the writers that write perverseness  to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right that widows may be their spoil and that they may make the fatherless their prey and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory  they shall only bow down under the prisoners and shall fall under the slain. for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still. ho assyrian the rod of mine anger the staff in whose hand is mine indignation i will send him against a profane nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not a few. for he saith are not my princes all of them kings is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria  shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks.  for he hath said by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i have understanding and i have removed the bounds of the peoples and have robbed their treasures and like a valiant man i have brought down them that sit [on thrones] and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or that opened the mouth or chirped. shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it as if a rod should wield them that lift it up [or] as if a staff should lift up [him that is] not wood. therefore will the lord jehovah of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.  and the light of israel will be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. and he will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and it shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth. and the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few so that a child may write them. and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and they that are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again lean upon him that smote them but shall lean upon jehovah the holy one of israel in truth. a remnant shall return [even] the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god. for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea [only] a remnant of them shall return a destruction [is] determined overflowing with righteousness. for a full end and that determined will the lord jehovah of hosts make in the midst of all the earth. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian though he smite thee with the rod and lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt.  for yet a very little while and the indignation [against thee] shall be accomplished and mine anger [shall be directed] to his destruction. and jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge as in the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and his rod will be over the sea and he will lift it up after the manner of egypt. and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness. he is come to aiath he is passed through migron at michmash he layeth up his baggage they are gone over the pass they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah trembleth gibeah of saul is fled. cry aloud with thy voice o daughter of gallim hearken o laishah o thou poor anathoth madmenah is a fugitive the inhabitants of gebim flee for safety. this very day shall he halt at nob he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem.  behold the lord jehovah of hosts will lop the boughs with terror and the high of stature shall be hewn down and the lofty shall be brought low. and he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. and there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of jesse and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit. and the spirit of jehovah shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of jehovah. and his delight shall be in the fear of jehovah and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither decide after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and decide with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. and righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist and faithfulness the girdle of his loins. and the wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them.  and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adders den. they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of jehovah as the waters cover the sea. and it shall come to pass in that day that the root of jesse that standeth for an ensign of the peoples unto him shall the nations seek and his restingplace shall be glorious. and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people that shall remain from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea. and he will set up an ensign for the nations and will assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth. the envy also of ephraim shall depart and they that vex judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim.  and they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the philistines on the west together shall they despoil the children of the east they shall put forth their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them. and jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his scorching wind will he wave his hand over the river and will smite it into seven streams and cause men to march over dryshod. and there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people that shall remain from assyria like as there was for israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt. and in that day thou shalt say i will give thanks unto thee o jehovah for though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortest me. behold god is my salvation i will trust and will not be afraid for jehovah [even] jehovah is my strength and song and he is become my salvation. therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. and in that day shall ye say give thanks unto jehovah call upon his name declare his doings among the peoples make mention that his name is exalted.  sing unto jehovah for he hath done excellent things let this be known in all the earth. cry aloud and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great in the midst of thee is the holy one of israel. the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see. set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain lift up the voice unto them wave the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles. i have commanded my consecrated ones yea i have called my mighty men for mine anger even my proudly exulting ones. the noise of a multitude in the mountains as of a great people the noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together jehovah of hosts is mustering the host for the battle. they come from a far country from the uttermost part of heaven even jehovah and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land. wail ye for the day of jehovah is at hand as destruction from the almighty shall it come. therefore shall all hands be feeble and every heart of man shall melt  and they shall be dismayed pangs and sorrows shall take hold [of them] they shall be in pain as a woman in travail they shall look in amazement one at another their faces [shall be] faces of flame. behold the day of jehovah cometh cruel with wrath and fierce anger to make the land a desolation and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in its going forth and the moon shall not cause its light to shine. and i will punish the world for [their] evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. i will make a man more rare than fine gold even a man than the pure gold of ophir. therefore i will make the heavens to tremble and the earth shall be shaken out of its place in the wrath of jehovah of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger. and it shall come to pass that as the chased roe and as sheep that no man gathereth they shall turn every man to his own people and shall flee every man to his own land.  every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword. their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes their houses shall be rifled and their wives ravished. behold i will stir up the medes against them who shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it. and [their] bows shall dash the young men in pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare children. and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldeans pride shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah. it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there. but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and ostriches shall dwell there and wild goats shall dance there. and wolves shall cry in their castles and jackals in the pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged.  for jehovah will have compassion on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the sojourner shall join himself with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob. and the peoples shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of jehovah for servants and for handmaids and they shall take them captive whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors. and it shall come to pass in the day that jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy trouble and from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked the sceptre of the rulers that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke that ruled the nations in anger with a persecution that none restrained. the whole earth is at rest [and] is quiet they break forth into singing. yea the firtrees rejoice at thee [and] the cedars of lebanon [saying] since thou art laid low no hewer is come up against us.  sheol from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. all they shall answer and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to sheol [and] the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and worms cover thee. how art thou fallen from heaven o day star son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground that didst lay low the nations and thou saidst in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god and i will sit upon the mount of congregation in the uttermost parts of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will make myself like the most high. yet thou shalt be brought down to sheol to the uttermost parts of the pit. they that see thee shall gaze at thee they shall consider thee [saying] is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and overthrew the cities thereof that let not loose his prisoners to their home  all the kings of the nations all of them sleep in glory every one in his own house. but thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch clothed with the slain that are thrust through with the sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a dead body trodden under foot. thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land thou hast slain thy people the seed of evil doers shall not be named for ever. prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they rise not up and possess the earth and fill the face of the world with cities. and i will rise up against them saith jehovah of hosts and cut off from babylon name and remnant and son and sons son saith jehovah. i will also make it a possession for the porcupine and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith jehovah of hosts. jehovah of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulder.  this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. for jehovah of hosts hath purposed and who shall annul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back in the year that king ahaz died was this burden. rejoice not o philistia all of thee because the rod that smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth an adder and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and thy remnant shall be slain. howl o gate cry o city thou art melted away o philistia all of thee for there cometh a smoke out of the north and there is no straggler in his ranks. what then shall one answer the messengers of the nation that jehovah hath founded zion and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge. the burden of moab. for in a night ar of moab is laid waste [and] brought to nought for in a night kir of moab is laid waste [and] brought to nought.  they are gone up to bayith and to dibon to the high places to weep moab waileth over nebo and over medeba on all their heads is baldness every beard is cut off. in their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth on their housetops and in their broad places every one waileth weeping abundantly. and heshbon crieth out and elealeh their voice is heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed men of moab cry aloud his soul trembleth within him. my heart crieth out for moab her nobles [flee] unto zoar to eglath shelishiyah for by the ascent of luhith with weeping they go up for in the way of horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction. for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the grass is withered away the tender grass faileth there is no green thing. therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away over the brook of the willows. for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the wailing thereof unto eglaim and the wailing thereof unto beerelim. for the waters of dimon are full of blood for i will bring yet more upon dimon a lion upon them of moab that escape and upon the remnant of the land.  send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from selah to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion. for it shall be that as wandering birds as a scattered nest so shall the daughters of moab be at the fords of the arnon. give counsel execute justice make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts betray not the fugitive. let mine outcasts dwell with thee as for moab be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. for the extortioner is brought to nought destruction ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land. and a throne shall be established in lovingkindness and one shall sit thereon in truth in the tent of david judging and seeking justice and swift to do righteousness. we have heard of the pride of moab [that] he is very proud even of his arrogancy and his pride and his wrath his boastings are nought. therefore shall moab wail for moab every one shall wail for the raisincakes of kirhareseth shall ye mourn utterly stricken.  for the fields of heshbon languish [and] the vine of sibmah the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches thereof which reached even unto jazer which wandered into the wilderness its shoots were spread abroad they passed over the sea. therefore i will weep with the weeping of jazer for the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the [battle] shout is fallen. and gladness is taken away and joy out of the fruitful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither joyful noise no treader shall tread out wine in the presses i have made the [vintage] shout to cease. wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for moab and mine inward parts for kirheres. and it shall come to pass when moab presenteth himself when he wearieth himself upon the high place and shall come to his sanctuary to pray that he shall not prevail. this is the word that jehovah spake concerning moab in time past.  but now jehovah hath spoken saying within three years as the years of a hireling the glory of moab shall be brought into contempt with all his great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and of no account. the burden of damascus. behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap. the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid. and the fortress shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the children of israel saith jehovah of hosts. and it shall come to pass in that day that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing grain and his arm reapeth the ears yea it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of rephaim.  yet there shall be left therein gleanings as the shaking of an olivetree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree saith jehovah the god of israel. in that day shall men look unto their maker and their eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel. and they shall not look to the altars the work of their hands neither shall they have respect to that which their fingers have made either the asherim or the sunimages. in that day shall their strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountain top which were forsaken from before the children of israel and it shall be a desolation.  for thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore thou plantest pleasant plants and settest it with strange slips. in the day of thy planting thou hedgest it in and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom but the harvest fleeth away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow. ah the uproar of many peoples that roar like the roaring of the seas and the rushing of nations that rush like the rushing of mighty waters  the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but he shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like the whirling dust before the storm. at eventide behold terror [and] before the morning they are not. this is the portion of them that despoil us and the lot of them that rob us. ah the land of the rustling of wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters [saying] go ye swift messengers to a nation tall and smooth to a people terrible from their beginning onward a nation that meteth out and treadeth down whose land the rivers divide  all ye inhabitants of the world and ye dwellers on the earth when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains see ye and when the trumpet is blown hear ye. for thus hath jehovah said unto me i will be still and i will behold in my dwellingplace like clear heat in sunshine like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.  for before the harvest when the blossom is over and the flower becometh a ripening grape he will cut off the sprigs with pruninghooks and the spreading branches will he take away [and] cut down. they shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. in that time shall a present be brought unto jehovah of hosts [from] a people tall and smooth even from a people terrible from their beginning onward a nation that meteth out and treadeth down whose land the rivers divide to the place of the name of jehovah of hosts the mount zion. the burden of egypt. behold jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud and cometh unto egypt and the idols of egypt shall tremble at his presence and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it.  and i will stir up the egyptians against the egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbor city against city [and] kingdom against kingdom.  and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst of it and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek unto the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards. and i will give over the egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord jehovah of hosts. and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and become dry. and the rivers shall become foul the streams of egypt shall be diminished and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither away. the meadows by the nile by the brink of the nile and all the sown fields of the nile shall become dry be driven away and be no more. and the fishers shall lament and all they that cast angle into the nile shall mourn and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. moreover they that work in combed flax and they that weave white cloth shall be confounded. and the pillars [of egypt] shall be broken in pieces all they that work for hire [shall be] grieved in soul. the princes of zoan are utterly foolish the counsel of the wisest counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings  where then are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning egypt. the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of memphis are deceived they have caused egypt to go astray that are the cornerstone of her tribes. jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her and they have caused egypt to go astray in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. neither shall there be for egypt any work which head or tail palmbranch or rush may do. in that day shall the egyptians be like unto women and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of jehovah of hosts which he shaketh over them. and the land of judah shall become a terror unto egypt every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid because of the purpose of jehovah of hosts which he purposeth against it. in that day there shall be five cities in the land of egypt that speak the language of canaan and swear to jehovah of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction.  in that day shall there be an altar to jehovah in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to jehovah. and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto jehovah of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto jehovah because of oppressors and he will send them a saviour and a defender and he will deliver them. and jehovah shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know jehovah in that day yea they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation and shall vow a vow unto jehovah and shall perform it. and jehovah will smite egypt smiting and healing and they shall return unto jehovah and he will be entreated of them and will heal them. in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall worship with the assyrians. in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria a blessing in the midst of the earth for that jehovah of hosts hath blessed them saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance.  in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king of assyria sent him and he fought against ashdod and took it at that time jehovah spake by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put thy shoe from off thy foot. and he did so walking naked and barefoot. and jehovah said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning egypt and concerning ethiopia so shall the king of assyria lead away the captives of egypt and the exiles of ethiopia young and old naked and barefoot and with buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt. and they shall be dismayed and confounded because of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory. and the inhabitant of this coastland shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and we how shall we escape the burden of the wilderness of the sea. as whirlwinds in the south sweep through it cometh from the wilderness from a terrible land.  a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous man dealeth treacherously and the destroyer destroyeth. go up o elam besiege o media all the sighing thereof have i made to cease. therefore are my loins filled with anguish pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman in travail i am pained so that i cannot hear i am dismayed so that i cannot see. my heart fluttereth horror hath affrighted me the twilight that i desired hath been turned into trembling unto me. they prepare the table they set the watch they eat they drink rise up ye princes anoint the shield. for thus hath the lord said unto me go set a watchman let him declare what he seeth and when he seeth a troop horsemen in pairs a troop of asses a troop of camels he shall hearken diligently with much heed. and he cried as a lion o lord i stand continually upon the watch tower in the day time and am set in my ward whole nights and behold here cometh a troop of men horsemen in pairs. and he answered and said fallen fallen is babylon and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.  o thou my threshing and the grain of my floor that which i have heard from jehovah of hosts the god of israel have i declared unto you. the burden of dumah. one calleth unto me out of seir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will inquire inquire ye turn ye come. the burden upon arabia. in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge o ye caravans of dedanites. unto him that was thirsty they brought water the inhabitants of the land of tema did meet the fugitives with their bread. for they fled away from the swords from the drawn sword and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war. for thus hath the lord said unto me within a year according to the years of a hireling all the glory of kedar shall fail and the residue of the number of the archers the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be few for jehovah the god of israel hath spoken it. the burden of the valley of vision. what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops  o thou that art full of shoutings a tumultuous city a joyous town thy slain are not slain with the sword neither are they dead in battle. all thy rulers fled away together they were bound by the archers all that were found of thee were bound together they fled afar off. therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. for it is a day of discomfiture and of treading down and of perplexity from the lord jehovah of hosts in the valley of vision a breaking down of the walls and a crying to the mountains. and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men [and] horsemen and kir uncovered the shield. and it came to pass that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate. and he took away the covering of judah and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest. and ye saw the breaches of the city of david that they were many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool and ye numbered the houses of jerusalem and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall  ye made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. but ye looked not unto him that had done this neither had ye respect unto him that purposed it long ago. and in that day did the lord jehovah of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth and behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die. and jehovah of hosts revealed himself in mine ears surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die saith the lord jehovah of hosts. thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts go get thee unto this treasurer even unto shebna who is over the house [and say] what doest thou here and whom has thou here that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre hewing him out a sepulchre on high graving a habitation for himself in the rock behold jehovah like a [strong] man will hurl thee away violently yea he will wrap thee up closely.  he will surely wind thee round and round [and toss thee] like a ball into a large country there shalt thou die and there shall be the chariots of thy glory thou shame of thy lords house. and i will thrust thee from thine office and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down. and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah and i will cloth him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah. and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open. and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a throne of glory to his fathers house. and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers house the offspring and the issue every small vessel from the cups even to all the flagons. in that day saith jehovah of hosts shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way and it shall be hewn down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for jehovah hath spoken it.  the burden of tyre. howl ye ships of tarshish for it is laid waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of kittim it is revealed to them. be still ye inhabitants of the coast thou whom the merchants of sidon that pass over the sea have replenished. and on great waters the seed of the shihor the harvest of the nile was her revenue and she was the mart of nations. be thou ashamed o sidon for the sea hath spoken the stronghold of the sea saying i have not travailed nor brought forth neither have i nourished young men nor brought up virgins. when the report cometh to egypt they shall be sorely pained at the report of tyre. pass ye over to tarshish wail ye inhabitants of the coast. is this your joyous [city] whose antiquity is of ancient days whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn who hath purposed this against tyre the bestower of crowns whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth jehovah of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.  pass through thy land as the nile o daughter of tarshish there is no restraint any more. he hath stretched out his hand over the sea he hath shaken the kingdoms jehovah hath given commandment concerning canaan to destroy the strongholds thereof. and he said thou shalt no more rejoice o thou oppressed virgin daughter of sidon arise pass over to kittim even there shalt thou have no rest. behold the land of the chaldeans this people was not the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up their towers they overthrew the palaces thereof they made it a ruin. howl ye ships of tarshish for your stronghold is laid waste. and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the end of seventy years it shall be unto tyre as in the song of the harlot. take a harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered.  and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that jehovah will visit tyre and she shall return to her hire and shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to jehovah it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before jehovah to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing. behold jehovah maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the creditor so with the debtor as with the taker of interest so with the giver of interest to him. the earth shall be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste for jehovah hath spoken this word. the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the lofty people of the earth do languish. the earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws violated the statutes broken the everlasting covenant.  therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are found guilty therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left. the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merry hearted do sigh. the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth. they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. the waste city is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come in. there is a crying in the streets because of the wine all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is gone. in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction. for thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples as the shaking of an olivetree as the gleanings when the vintage is done. these shall lift up their voice they shall shout for the majesty of jehovah they cry aloud from the sea. wherefore glorify ye jehovah in the east even the name of jehovah the god of israel in the isles of the sea.  from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs glory to the righteous. but i said i pine away i pine away woe is me the treacherous have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous have dealt very treacherously. fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of the earth. and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows on high are opened and the foundations of the earth tremble. the earth is utterly broken the earth is rent asunder the earth is shaken violently. the earth shall stagger like a drunken man and shall sway to and fro like a hammock and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again. and it shall come to pass in that day that jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth. and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited.  then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed for jehovah of hosts will reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his elders shall be glory. o jehovah thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things [even] counsels of old in faithfulness [and] truth. for thou hast made of a city a heap of a fortified city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built. therefore shall a strong people glorify thee a city of terrible nations shall fear thee. for thou hast been a stronghold to the poor a stronghold to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shade from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. as the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers as the heat by the shade of a cloud the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low. and in this mountain will jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined.  and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples and the veil that is spread over all nations. he hath swallowed up death for ever and the lord jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth for jehovah hath spoken it. and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is jehovah we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. for in this mountain will the hand of jehovah rest and moab shall be trodden down in his place even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill. and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim but [jehovah] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands. and the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down laid low and brought to the ground even to the dust. in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks. open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.  thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee] because he trusteth in thee. trust ye in jehovah for ever for in jehovah [even] jehovah is an everlasting rock. for he hath brought down them that dwell on high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust. the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy. the way of the just is uprightness thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just. yea in the way of thy judgments o jehovah have we waited for thee to thy name even to thy memorial [name] is the desire of our soul. with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will i seek thee earnestly for when thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.  let favor be showed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully and will not behold the majesty of jehovah.  jehovah thy hand is lifted up yet they see not but they shall see [thy] zeal for the people and be put to shame yea fire shall devour thine adversaries. jehovah thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou hast also wrought all our works for us. o jehovah our god other lords besides thee have had dominion over us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. [they are] dead they shall not live [they are] deceased they shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and made all remembrance of them to perish. thou hast increased the nation o jehovah thou hast increased the nation thou art glorified thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land. jehovah in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening was upon them. like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so we have been before thee o jehovah. we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.  thy dead shall live my dead bodies shall arise. awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust for thy dew is [as] the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast forth the dead. come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself for a little moment until the indignation be overpast. for behold jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain. in that day jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent and leviathan the crooked serpent and he will slay the monster that is in the sea. in that day a vineyard of wine sing ye unto it. i jehovah am its keeper i will water it every moment lest any hurt it i will keep it night and day. wrath is not in me would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle i would march upon them i would burn them together. or else let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me [yea] let him make peace with me.  in days to come shall jacob take root israel shall blossom and bud and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit. hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them in measure when thou sendest them away thou dost contend with them he hath removed [them] with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. therefore by this shall the iniquity of jacob be forgiven and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder [so that] the asherim and the sunimages shall rise no more. for the fortified city is solitary a habitation deserted and forsaken like the wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof. when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off the women shall come and set them on fire for it is a people of no understanding therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them and he that formed them will show them no favor.  and it shall come to pass in that day that jehovah will beat off [his fruit] from the flood of the river unto the brook of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel. and it shall come to pass in that day that a great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of assyria and they that were outcasts in the land of egypt and they shall worship jehovah in the holy mountain at jerusalem. woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of ephraim and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one as a tempest of hail a destroying storm as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing will he cast down to the earth with the hand. the crown of pride of the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under foot and the fading flower of his glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be as the firstripe fig before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.  in that day will jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate. and even these reel with wine and stagger with strong drink the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they stagger with strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment. for all tables are full of vomit [and] filthiness [so that there is] no place [clean]. whom will he teach knowledge and whom will he make to understand the message them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for it is precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little. nay but by [men of] strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest give ye rest to him that is weary and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear.  therefore shall the word of jehovah be unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little that they may go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken. wherefore hear the word of jehovah ye scoffers that rule this people that is in jerusalem because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with sheol are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner [stone] of sure foundation he that believeth shall not be in haste. and i will make justice the line and righteousness the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hidingplace. and your covenant with death shall be annulled and your agreement with sheol shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it.  as often as it passeth though it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass through by day and by night and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message. for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. for jehovah will rise up as in mount perazim he will be wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act. now therefore be ye not scoffers lest your bonds be made strong for a decree of destruction have i heard from the lord jehovah of hosts upon the whole earth. give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech. doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually doth he [continually] open and harrow his ground when he hath levelled the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place and the spelt in the border thereof for his god doth instruct him aright [and] doth teach him.  for the fitches are not threshed with a sharp [threshing] instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod. bread [grain] is ground for he will not be always threshing it and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it he doth not grind it. this also cometh forth from jehovah of hosts who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom. ho ariel ariel the city where david encamped add ye year to year let the feasts come round then will i distress ariel and there shall be mourning and lamentation and she shall be unto me as ariel. and i will encamp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with posted troops and i will raise siege works against thee. and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.  but the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be in an instant suddenly. she shall be visited of jehovah of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire. and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her stronghold and that distress her shall be as a dream a vision of the night. and it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion. tarry ye and wonder take your pleasure and be blind they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink. for jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your heads the seers hath he covered.  and all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned. and the lord said forasmuch as this people draw nigh [unto me] and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught [them] therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from jehovah and whose works are in the dark and that say who seeth us and who knoweth us ye turn things upside down shall the potter be esteemed as clay that the thing made should say of him that made it he made me not or the thing formed say of him that formed it he hath no understanding  is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. the meek also shall increase their joy in jehovah and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel. for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scoffer ceaseth and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off that make a man an offender in [his] cause and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. therefore thus saith jehovah who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale. but when he seeth his children the work of my hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name yea they shall sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall stand in awe of the god of israel. they also that err in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmur shall receive instruction.  woe to the rebellious children saith jehovah that take counsel but not of me and that make a league but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that set out to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to take refuge in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the refuge in the shadow of egypt your confusion. for their princes are at zoan and their ambassadors are come to hanes. they shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them that are not a help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach. the burden of the beasts of the south. through the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the lioness and the lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the humps of camels to a people that shall not profit [them]. for egypt helpeth in vain and to no purpose therefore have i called her rahab that sitteth still. now go write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.  for it is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of jehovah that say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us. wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and rely thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant. and he shall break it as a potters vessel is broken breaking it in pieces without sparing so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth or to dip up water out of the cistern. for thus said the lord jehovah the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. and ye would not  but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. one thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one at the threat of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on a hill. and therefore will jehovah wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for jehovah is a god of justice blessed are all they that wait for him. for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear he will answer thee. and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore but thine eyes shall see thy teachers and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left.  and ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver and the plating of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing thou shalt say unto it get thee hence. and he will give the rain for thy seed wherewith thou shalt sow the ground and bread of the increase of the ground and it shall be fat and plenteous. in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. and there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill brooks [and] streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall. moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound. behold the name of jehovah cometh from far burning with his anger and in thick rising smoke his lips are full of indignation and his tongue is as a devouring fire  and his breath is as an overflowing stream that reacheth even unto the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction and a bridle that causeth to err [shall be] in the jaws of the peoples. ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of jehovah to the rock of israel. and jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard and will show the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of [his] anger and the flame of a devouring fire with a blast and tempest and hailstones. for through the voice of jehovah shall the assyrian be dismayed with his rod will he smite [him]. and every stroke of the appointed staff which jehovah shall lay upon him shall be with [the sound of] tabrets and harps and in battles with the brandishing [of his arm] will he fight with them. for a topheth is prepared of old yea for the king it is made ready he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of jehovah like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it.  woe to them that go down to egypt for help and rely on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek jehovah yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evil doers and against the help of them that work iniquity. now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit and when jehovah shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall stumble and he that is helped shall fall and they all shall be consumed together. for thus saith jehovah unto me as the lion and the young lion growling over his prey if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him will not be dismayed at their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so will jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount zion and upon the hill thereof. as birds hovering so will jehovah of hosts protect jerusalem he will protect and deliver [it] he will pass over and preserve [it]. turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted o children of israel.  for in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. and the assyrian shall fall by the sword not of man and the sword not of men shall devour him and he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall become subject to taskwork. and his rock shall pass away by reason of terror and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign saith jehovah whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem. behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in justice. and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as streams of water in a dry place as the shade of a great rock in a weary land. and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. the fool shall be no more called noble nor the churl said to be bountiful.  for the fool will speak folly and his heart will work iniquity to practise profaneness and to utter error against jehovah to make empty the soul of the hungry and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. and the instruments of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words even when the needy speaketh right. but the noble deviseth noble things and in noble things shall he continue. rise up ye women that are at ease [and] hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech. for days beyond a year shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the ingathering shall not come. tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird [sackcloth] upon your loins. they shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine. upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.  for the palace shall be forsaken the populous city shall be deserted the hill and the watch tower shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocks until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness become a fruitful field and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest. then justice shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field. and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever. and my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation and in safe dwellings and in quiet restingplaces. but it shall hail in the downfall of the forest and the city shall be utterly laid low.  blessed are yet that sow beside all waters that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass. woe to thee that destroyest and thou wast not destroyed and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou hast ceased to destroy thou shalt be destroyed and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee.  o jehovah be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou our arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble. at the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered. and your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth as locusts leap shall men leap upon it. jehovah is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with justice and righteousness. and there shall be stability in thy times abundance of salvation wisdom and knowledge the fear of jehovah is thy treasure. behold their valiant ones cry without the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth [the enemy] hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth not man.  the land mourneth and languisheth lebanon is confounded and withereth away sharon is like a desert and bashan and carmel shake off [their leaves]. now will i arise saith jehovah now will i lift up myself now will i be exalted. ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath is a fire that shall devour you.  and the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut down that are burned in the fire. hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might. the sinners in zion are afraid trembling hath seized the godless ones who among us can dwell with the devouring fire who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks his bread shall be given [him] his waters shall be sure. thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.  thy heart shall muse on the terror where is he that counted where is he that weighed [the tribute] where is he that counted the towers thou shalt not see the fierce people a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.  look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tent that shall not be removed the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. but there jehovah will be with us in majesty a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. for jehovah is our judge jehovah is our lawgiver jehovah is our king he will save us. thy tacklings are loosed they could not strengthen the foot of their mast they could not spread the sail then was the prey of a great spoil divided the lame took the prey. and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye peoples let the earth hear and the fulness thereof the world and all things that come forth from it. for jehovah hath indignation against all the nations and wrath against all their host he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter.  their slain also shall be cast out and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fade away as the leaf fadeth from off the vine and as a fading [leaf] from the figtree. for my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven behold it shall come down upon edom and upon the people of my curse to judgment. the sword of jehovah is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for jehovah hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of edom. and the wild oxen shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be drunken with blood and their dust made fat with fatness. for jehovah hath a day of vengeance a year of recompense for the cause of zion. and the streams of [edom] shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.  it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and ever. but the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein and he will stretch over it the line of confusion and the plummet of emptiness. they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all its princes shall be nothing. and thorns shall come up in its palaces nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be a habitation of jackals a court for ostriches. and the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow yea the nightmonster shall settle there and shall find her a place of rest. there shall the dartsnake make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shade yea there shall the kites be gathered every one with her mate. seek ye out of the book of jehovah and read no one of these shall be missing none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them.  and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein. the wilderness and the dry land shall be glad and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of jehovah the excellency of our god. strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees. say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come [with] vengeance [with] the recompense of god he will come and save you. then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. then shall the lame man leap as a hart and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert. and the glowing sand shall become a pool and the thirsty ground springs of water in the habitation of jackals where they lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes.  and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but is shall be for [the redeemed] the wayfaring men yea fools shall not err [therein]. no lion shall be there nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon they shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk [there] and the ransomed of jehovah shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the fortified cities of judah and took them. and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army. and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field. then came forth unto him eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder.  and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest i say [thy] counsel and strength for the war are but vain words now on whom dost thou trust that thou hast rebelled against me behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust on him. but if thou say unto me we trust in jehovah our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. how then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen and am i now come up without jehovah against this land to destroy it jehovah said unto me go up against this land and destroy it.  then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words [hath he] not [sent me] to the men that sit upon the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria. thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he will not be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in jehovah saying jehovah will surely deliver us this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria. hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make your peace with me and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his figtree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards.  beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying jehovah will deliver us. hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand that jehovah should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not. then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh. and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of jehovah. and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz.  and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of contumely for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth. it may be jehovah thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to defy the living god and will rebuke the words which jehovah thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah. and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith jehovah be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me. behold i will put a spirit in him and he shall hear tidings and shall return unto his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish. and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come out to fight against thee. and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying  thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria. behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden that were in telassar where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of jehovah and spread it before jehovah. and hezekiah prayed unto jehovah saying o jehovah of hosts the god of israel that sittest [above] the cherubim thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth. incline thine ear o jehovah and hear open thine eyes o jehovah and see and hear all the words of sennacherib who hath sent to defy the living god.  of a truth jehovah the kings of assyria have laid waste all the countries and their land and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them. now therefore o jehovah our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art jehovah even thou only. then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith jehovah the god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria this is the word which jehovah hath spoken concerning him the virgin daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. whom hast thou defied and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high [even] against the holy one of israel.  by thy servants hast thou defied the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the innermost parts of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice firtrees thereof and i will enter into its farthest height the forest of its fruitful field i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet will i dry up all the rivers of egypt. hast thou not heard how i have done it long ago and formed it of ancient times now have i brought it to pass that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as a field [of grain] before it is grown up. but i know thy sitting down and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me. because of thy raging against me and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.  and this shall be the sign unto thee ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and out of mount zion they that shall escape. the zeal of jehovah of hosts will perform this. therefore thus saith jehovah concerning the king of assyria he shall not come unto this city nor shoot an arrow there neither shall he come before it with shield nor cast up a mound against it. by the way that he came by the same shall he return and he shall not come unto this city saith jehovah. for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake. and the angel of jehovah went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when men arose early in the morning behold these were all dead bodies. so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh.  and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of ararat. and esar haddon his son reigned in his stead. in those days was hezekiah sick unto death. and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith jehovah set thy house in order for thou shalt die and not live. then hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed unto jehovah and said remember now o jehovah i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight. and hezekiah wept sore. then came the word of jehovah to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith jehovah the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years. and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city. and this shall be the sign unto thee from jehovah that jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken  behold i will cause the shadow on the steps which is gone down on the dial of ahaz with the sun to return backward ten steps. so the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down. the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness. i said in the noontide of my days i shall go into the gates of sheol i am deprived of the residue of my years. i said i shall not see jehovah [even] jehovah in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. my dwelling is removed and is carried away from me as a shepherds tent i have rolled up like a weaver my life he will cut me off from the loom from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. i quieted [myself] until morning as a lion so he breaketh all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. like a swallow [or] a crane so did i chatter i did moan as a dove mine eyes fail [with looking] upward o lord i am oppressed be thou my surety. what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.  o lord by these things men live and wholly therein is the life of my spirit wherefore recover thou me and make me to live. behold [it was] for [my] peace [that] i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. for sheol cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth. jehovah is [ready] to save me therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of jehovah. now isaiah had said let them take a cake of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil and he shall recover. hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of jehovah at that time merodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he heard that he had been sick and was recovered.  and hezekiah was glad of them and showed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and all the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah showed them not. then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon. then said he what have they seen in thy house and hezekiah answered all that is in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not showed them. then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of jehovah of hosts behold the days are coming when all that is in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith jehovah.  and of thy sons that shall issue from thee whom thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon.  then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of jehovah which thou hast spoken. he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days. comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god. speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned that she hath received of jehovahs hand double for all her sins. the voice of one that crieth prepare ye in the wilderness the way of jehovah make level in the desert a highway for our god. every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the uneven shall be made level and the rough places a plain and the glory of jehovah shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it. the voice of one saying cry. and one said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.  the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the breath of jehovah bloweth upon it surely the people is grass. the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand forever.  o thou that tellest good tidings to zion get thee up on a high mountain o thou that tellest good tidings to jerusalem lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord jehovah will come as a mighty one and his arm will rule for him behold his reward is with him and his recompense before him. he will feed his flock like a shepherd he will gather the lambs in his arm and carry them in his bosom [and] will gently lead those that have their young. who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance who hath directed the spirit of jehovah or being his counsellor hath taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of justice and taught him knowledge and showed to him the way of understanding  behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are accounted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burntoffering. all the nations are as nothing before him they are accounted by him as less than nothing and vanity. to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him the image a workman hath cast [it] and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold and casteth [for it] silver chains. he that is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image that shall not be moved. have ye not known have yet not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth [it is] he that sitteth above the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth princes to nothing that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.  yea they have not been planted yea they have not been sown yea their stock hath not taken root in the earth moreover he bloweth upon them and they wither and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble. to whom then will ye liken me that i should be equal [to him] saith the holy one. lift up your eyes on high and see who hath created these that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by name by the greatness of his might and for that he is strong in power not one is lacking. why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from jehovah and the justice [due] to me is passed away from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard the everlasting god jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding. he giveth power to the faint and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait for jehovah shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint.  keep silence before me o islands and let the peoples renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment. who hath raised up one from the east whom he calleth in righteousness to his foot he giveth nations before him and maketh him rule over kings he giveth them as the dust to his sword as the driven stubble to his bow. he pursueth them and passeth on safely even by a way that he had not gone with his feet. who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i jehovah the first and with the last i am he. the isles have seen and fear the ends of the earth tremble they draw near and come. they help every one his neighbor and [every one] saith to his brother be of good courage. so the carpenter encourageth the goldsmith [and] he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil saying of the soldering it is good and he fasteneth it with nails that is should not be moved. but thou israel my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend  thou whom i have taken hold of from the ends of the earth and called from the corners thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. behold all they that are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded they that strive with thee shall be as nothing and shall perish. thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contend with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought. for i jehovah thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee. fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith jehovah and thy redeemer is the holy one of israel. behold i have made thee [to be] a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff.  thou shalt winnow them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in jehovah thou shalt glory in the holy one of israel. the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i jehovah will answer them i the god of israel will not forsake them. i will open rivers on the bare heights and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water. i will put in the wilderness the cedar the acacia and the myrtle and the oiltree i will set in the desert the firtree the pine and the boxtree together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of jehovah hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it. produce your cause saith jehovah bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob. let them bring forth and declare unto us what shall happen declare ye the former things what they are that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or show us things to come.  declare the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together. behold ye are of nothing and your work is of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you. i have raised up one from the north and he is come from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon my name and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar and as the potter treadeth clay. who hath declared it from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say [he is] right yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that showeth yea there is none that heareth your words. [i am the] first [that saith] unto zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. and when i look there is no man even among them there is no counsellor that when i ask of them can answer a word. behold all of them their works are vanity [and] nought their molten images are wind and confusion. behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he will bring forth justice to the gentiles.  he will not cry nor lift up his voice nor cause it to be heard in the street. a bruised reed will he not break and a dimly burning wick will he not quench he will bring forth justice in truth. he will not fail nor be discouraged till he have set justice in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law. thus saith god jehovah he that created the heavens and stretched them forth he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein i jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thy hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon and them that sit in darkness out of the prisonhouse. i am jehovah that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise unto graven images. behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them.  sing unto jehovah a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof. let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice] the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of sela sing let them shout from the top of the mountains. let them give glory unto jehovah and declare his praise in the islands. jehovah will go forth as a mighty man he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war he will cry yea he will shout aloud he will do mightily against his enemies. i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself [now] will i cry out like a travailing woman i will gasp and pant together. i will lay waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and will dry up the pools. and i will bring the blind by a way that they know not in paths that they know not will i lead them i will make darkness light before them and crooked places straight. these things will i do and i will not forsake them.  they shall be turned back they shall be utterly put to shame that trust in graven images that say unto molten images ye are our gods. hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see. who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i send who is blind as he that is at peace [with me] and blind as jehovahs servant thou seest many things but thou observest not his ears are open but he heareth not. it pleased jehovah for his righteousness sake to magnify the law and make it honorable. but this is a people robbed and plundered they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore. who is there among you that will give ear to this that will hearken and hear for the time to come who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not jehovah he against whom we have sinned and in whose ways they would not walk neither were they obedient unto his law.  therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger and the strength of battle and it set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart. but now thus saith jehovah that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine. when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. for i am jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i have given egypt as thy ransom ethiopia and seba in thy stead. since thou hast been precious in my sight [and] honorable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men in thy stead and peoples instead of thy life. fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the end of the earth  every one that is called by my name and whom i have created for my glory whom i have formed yea whom i have made. bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears. let all the nations be gathered together and let the peoples be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth. ye are my witnesses saith jehovah and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me. i even i am jehovah and besides me there is no saviour. i have declared and i have saved and i have showed and there was no strange [god] among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith jehovah and i am god. yea since the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who can hinder it thus saith jehovah your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and i will bring down all of them as fugitives even the chaldeans in the ships of their rejoicing.  i am jehovah your holy one the creator of israel your king. thus saith jehovah who maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters who bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the mighty man they lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as a wick remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old. behold i will do a new thing now shall it spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. the beasts of the field shall honor me the jackals and the ostriches because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen the people which i formed for myself that they might set forth my praise. yet thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel. thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt offerings neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. i have not burdened thee with offerings nor wearied thee with frankincense.  thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast burdened me with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and i will not remember thy sins. put me in remembrance let us plead together set thou forth [thy cause] that thou mayest be justified. thy first father sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me. therefore i will profane the princes of the sanctuary and i will make jacob a curse and israel a reviling. yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel who i have chosen thus saith jehovah that made thee and formed thee from the womb who will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jeshurun whom i have chosen. for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and streams upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring and they shall spring up among the grass as willows by the watercourses.  one shall say i am jehovahs and another shall call [himself] by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto jehovah and surname [himself] by the name of israel. thus saith jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and besides me there is no god. and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i established the ancient people and the things that are coming and that shall come to pass let them declare. fear ye not neither be afraid have i not declared unto thee of old and showed it and ye are my witnesses. is there a god besides me yea there is no rock i know not any. they that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity and the things that they delight in shall not profit and their own witnesses see not nor know that they may be put to shame. who hath fashioned a god or molten an image that is profitable for nothing  behold all his fellows shall be put to shame and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up they shall fear they shall be put to shame together. the smith [maketh] an axe and worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with his strong arm yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint. the carpenter stretcheth out a line he marketh it out with a pencil he shapeth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compasses and shapeth it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man to dwell in a house. he heweth him down cedars and taketh the holm tree and the oak and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest he planteth a firtree and the rain doth nourish it. then shall it be for a man to burn and he taketh thereof and warmeth himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto.  he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire. and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god. they know not neither do they consider for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand. and none calleth to mind neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside and he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand remember these things o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me.  i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee. sing o ye heavens for jehovah hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for jehovah hath redeemed jacob and will glorify himself in israel. thus saith jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth who is with me that frustrateth the signs of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith of jerusalem she shall be inhabited and of the cities of judah they shall be built and i will raise up the waste places thereof that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers that saith of cyrus [he is] my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying of jerusalem she shall be built and of the temple thy foundation shall be laid.  thus saith jehovah to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open the doors before him and the gates shall not be shut i will go before thee and make the rough places smooth i will break in pieces the doors of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that it is i jehovah who call thee by thy name even the god of israel.  for jacob my servants sake and israel my chosen i have called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me. i am jehovah and there is none else besides me there is no god. i will gird thee though thou hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides me i am jehovah and there is none else. i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil. i am jehovah that doeth all these things.  distil ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open that it may bring forth salvation and let it cause righteousness to spring up together i jehovah have created it. woe unto him that striveth with his maker a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands woe unto him that saith unto a father what begettest thou or to a woman with what travailest thou  thus saith jehovah the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of the things that are to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me. i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded. i have raised him up in righteousness and i will make straight all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let my exiles go free not for price nor reward saith jehovah of hosts.  thus saith jehovah the labor of egypt and the merchandise of ethiopia and the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall go after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee [saying] surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god. verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour. they shall be put to shame yea confounded all of them they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols. [but] israel shall be saved by jehovah with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.  for thus saith jehovah that created the heavens the god that formed the earth and made it that established it and created it not a waste that formed it to be inhabited i am jehovah and there is none else. i have not spoken in secret in a place of the land of darkness i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i jehovah speak righteousness i declare things that are right.  assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save. declare ye and bring [it] forth yea let them take counsel together who hath showed this from ancient time who hath declared it of old have not i jehovah and there is no god else besides me a just god and a saviour there is none besides me. look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else. by myself have i sworn the word is gone forth from my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear. only in jehovah it is said of me is righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame. in jehovah shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory. bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols are upon the beasts and upon the cattle the things that ye carried about are made a load a burden to the weary [beast]. they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity.  hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel that have been borne [by me] from their birth that have been carried from the womb and even to old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry [you] i have made and i will bear yea i will carry and will deliver. to whom will ye like me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like such as lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance they hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship. they bear it upon the shoulder they carry it and set it in its place and it standeth from its place shall it not remove yea one may cry unto it yet can it not answer nor save him out of his trouble. remember this and show yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors. remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else [i am] god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure  calling a ravenous bird from the east the man of my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken i will also bring it to pass i have purposed i will also do it. hearken unto me ye stout hearted that are far from righteousness i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory. come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground without a throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. take the millstones and grind meal remove thy veil strip off the train uncover the leg pass through the rivers. thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and will spare no man. our redeemer jehovah of hosts is his name the holy one of israel. sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.  i was wroth with my people i profaned mine inheritance and gave them into thy hand thou didst show them no mercy upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. and thou saidst i shall be mistress for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end thereof. now therefore hear this thou that art given to pleasures that sittest securely that sayest in thy heart i am and there is none else besides me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood in their full measure shall they come upon thee in the multitude of thy sorceries and the great abundance of thine enchantments. for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thy heart i am and there is none else besides me. therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know the dawning thereof and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it away and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou knowest not.  stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast labored from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail. thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee. behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame it shall not be a coal to warm at nor a fire to sit before. thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter there shall be none to save thee. hear ye this o house of jacob who are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah who swear by the name of jehovah and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel jehovah of hosts is his name  i have declared the former things from of old yea they went forth out of my mouth and i showed them suddenly i did them and they came to pass. because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass therefore i have declared it to thee from of old before it came to pass i showed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them. thou hast heard it behold all this and ye will ye not declare it i have showed thee new things from this time even hidden things which thou hast not known. they are created now and not from of old and before this day thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them. yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from of old thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou didst deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb. for my names sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off. behold i have refined thee but not as silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.  for mine own sake for mine own sake will i do it for how should [my name] be profaned and my glory will i not give to another. hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last. yea my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spread out the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together. assemble yourselves all ye and hear who among them hath declared these things he whom jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on babylon and his arm [shall be on] the chaldeans. i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous. come ye near unto me hear ye this from the beginning i have not spoken in secret from the time that it was there am i and now the lord jehovah hath sent me and his spirit. thus saith jehovah thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am jehovah thy god who teacheth thee to profit who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.  oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me. go ye forth from babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye jehovah hath redeemed his servant jacob. and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out. there is no peace saith jehovah to the wicked. listen o isles unto me and hearken ye peoples from far jehovah hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and he hath made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he kept me close and he said unto me thou art my servant israel in whom i will be glorified.  but i said i have labored in vain i have spent my strength for nought and vanity yet surely the justice [due] to me is with jehovah and my recompense with my god. and now saith jehovah that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him and that israel be gathered unto him for i am honorable in the eyes of jehovah and my god is become my strength yea he saith it is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. thus saith jehovah the redeemer of israel [and] his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes and they shall worship because of jehovah that is faithful [even] the holy one of israel who hath chosen thee.  thus saith jehovah in an acceptable time have i answered thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to raise up the land to make them inherit the desolate heritages saying to them that are bound go forth to them that are in darkness show yourselves. they shall feed in the ways and on all bare heights shall be their pasture. they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them will lead them even by springs of water will he guide them. and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted. lo these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim. sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for jehovah hath comforted his people and will have compassion upon his afflicted. but zion said jehovah hath forsaken me and the lord hath forgotten me. can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea these may forget yet will not i forget thee.  behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me. thy children make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee. lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee. as i live saith jehovah thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and gird thyself with them like a bride. for as for thy waste and thy desolate places and thy land that hath been destroyed surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. the children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell. then shalt thou say in thy heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have been bereaved of my children and am solitary an exile and wandering to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where were they  thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will lift up my hand to the nations and set up my ensign to the peoples and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth and lick the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am jehovah and they that wait for me shall not be put to shame. shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captives be delivered but thus saith jehovah even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children. and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i jehovah am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob.  thus saith jehovah where is the bill of your mothers divorcement wherewith i have put her away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities were ye sold and for your transgressions was your mother put away. wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stink because there is no water and die for thirst. i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering. the lord jehovah hath given me the tongue of them that are taught that i may know how to sustain with words him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught. the lord jehovah hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither turned away backward. i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting.  for the lord jehovah will help me therefore have i not been confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be put to shame. he is near that justifieth me who will content with me let us stand up together who is mine adversary let him come near to me. behold the lord jehovah will help me who is he that shall condemn me behold all they shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up. who is among you that feareth jehovah that obeyeth the voice of his servant he that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of jehovah and rely upon his god. behold all ye that kindle a fire that gird yourselves about with firebrands walk ye in the flame of your fire and among the brands that ye have kindled. this shall ye have of my hand ye shall lie down in sorrow. hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek jehovah look unto the rock whence ye were hewn and to the hold of the pit whence ye were digged. look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for when he was but one i called him and i blessed him and made him many.  for jehovah hath comforted zion he hath comforted all her waste places and hath made her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of jehovah joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody. attend unto me o my people and give ear unto me o my nation for a law shall go forth from me and i will establish my justice for a light of the peoples. my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the peoples the isles shall wait for me and on mine arm shall they trust. lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished. hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye dismayed at their revilings. for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation unto all generations.  awake awake put on strength o arm of jehovah awake as in the days of old the generations of ancient times. is it not thou that didst cut rahab in pieces that didst pierce the monster is it not thou that driedst up the sea the waters of the great deep that madest the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over and the ransomed of jehovah shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads they shall obtain gladness and joy [and] sorrow and sighing shall flee away. i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou art afraid of man that shall die and of the son of man that shall be made as grass and hast forgotten jehovah thy maker that stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor when he maketh ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor the captive exile shall speedily be loosed and he shall not die [and go down] into the pit neither shall his bread fail.  for i am jehovah thy god who stirreth up the sea so that the waves thereof roar jehovah of hosts is his name. and i have put my words in thy mouth and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people. awake awake stand up o jerusalem that hast drunk at the hand of jehovah the cup of his wrath thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering and drained it. there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up. these two things are befallen thee who shall bemoan thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword how shall i comfort thee thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as an antelope in a net they are full of the wrath of jehovah the rebuke of thy god. therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but now with wine  thus saith thy lord jehovah and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering even the bowl of the cup of my wrath thou shalt no more drink it again  and i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee that have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy back as the ground and as the street to them that go over. awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. shake thyself from the dust arise sit [on thy throne] o jerusalem loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck o captive daughter of zion. for thus saith jehovah ye were sold for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money. for thus saith the lord jehovah my people went down at the first into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian hath oppressed them without cause.  now therefore what do i here saith jehovah seeing that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them do howl saith jehovah and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.  therefore my people shall know my name therefore [they shall know] in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i. how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth the voice of thy watchmen they lift up the voice together do they sing for they shall see eye to eye when jehovah returneth to zion. break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for jehovah hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem. jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god. depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her cleanse yourselves ye that bear the vessels of jehovah.  for ye shall not go out in haste neither shall ye go by flight for jehovah will go before you and the god of israel will be your rearward. behold my servant shall deal wisely he shall be exalted and lifted up and shall be very high.  like as many were astonished at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they understand. who hath believed our message and to whom hath the arm of jehovah been revealed for he grew up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we see him there is no beauty that we should desire him. he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised and we esteemed him not. surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted.  but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. he was oppressed yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth as a lamb that is led to the slaughter and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth. by oppression and judgment he was taken away and as for his generation who [among them] considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke [was due] and they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death although he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth. yet it pleased jehovah to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see [his] seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of jehovah shall prosper in his hand.  he shall see of the travail of his soul [and] shall be satisfied by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many and he shall bear their iniquities. therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his soul unto death and was numbered with the transgressors yet he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith jehovah. enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes. for thou shalt spread aboard on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall possess the nations and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.  for thy maker is thy husband jehovah of hosts is his name and the holy one of israel is thy redeemer the god of the whole earth shall he be called. for jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit even a wife of youth when she is cast off saith thy god. for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee. in overflowing wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting lovingkindness will i have mercy on thee saith jehovah thy redeemer. for this is [as] the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah shall no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i will not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee. for the mountains may depart and the hills be removed but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee neither shall my covenant of peace be removed saith jehovah that hath mercy on thee. o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will set thy stones in fair colors and lay thy foundations with sapphires. and i will make thy pinnacles of rubies and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy border of precious stones.  and all thy children shall be taught of jehovah and great shall be the peace of thy children. in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee. behold they may gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee. behold i have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals and bringeth forth a weapon for his work and i have created the waster to destroy. no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. this is the heritage of the servants of jehovah and their righteousness which is of me saith jehovah. ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price. wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness.  incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david. behold i have given him for a witness to the peoples a leader and commander to the peoples. behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of jehovah thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee. seek ye jehovah while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto jehovah and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon. for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith jehovah. for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater  so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it. for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands. instead of the thorn shall come up the firtree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtletree and it shall be to jehovah for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. thus saith jehovah keep ye justice and do righteousness for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed. blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that holdeth it fast that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. neither let the foreigner that hath joined himself to jehovah speak saying jehovah will surely separate me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree.  for thus saith jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant unto them will i give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off. also the foreigners that join themselves to jehovah to minister unto him and to love the name of jehovah to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it and holdeth fast my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burntofferings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. the lord jehovah who gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather [others] to him besides his own that are gathered. all ye beasts of the field come to devour [yea] all ye beasts in the forest. his watchmen are blind they are all without knowledge they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark dreaming lying down loving to slumber.  yea the dogs are greedy they can never have enough and these are shepherds that cannot understand they have all turned to their own way each one to his gain from every quarter. come ye [say they] i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and tomorrow shall be as this day [a day] great beyond measure. the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come]. he entereth into peace they rest in their beds each one that walketh in his uprightness. but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the harlot. against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and put out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks under every green tree that slay the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks among the smooth [stones] of the valley is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drinkoffering thou hast offered an oblation. shall i be appeased for these things  upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. and behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial for thou hast uncovered [thyself] to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. and thou wentest to the king with oil and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thine ambassadors far off and didst debase thyself even unto sheol. thou wast wearied with the length of thy way yet saidst thou not it is in vain thou didst find a quickening of thy strength therefore thou wast not faint. and of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear that thou liest and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of long time and thou fearest me not i will declare thy righteousness and as for thy works they shall not profit thee. when thou criest let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee but the wind shall take them a breath shall carry them all away but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain.  and he will say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people. for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite. for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit would faint before me and the souls that i have made. for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid [my face] and was wroth and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith jehovah and i will heal him. but the wicked are like the troubled sea for it cannot rest and its waters cast up mire and dirt. there is no peace saith my god to the wicked. cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and declare unto my people their transgression and to the house of jacob their sins.  yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me righteous judgments they delight to draw near unto god. wherefore have we fasted [say they] and thou seest not [wherefore] have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find [your own] pleasure and exact all your labors. behold ye fast for strife and contention and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. is such the fast that i have chosen the day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a rush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to jehovah is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke  is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of jehovah shall by thy rearward. then shalt thou call and jehovah will answer thou shalt cry and he will say here i am. if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking wickedly and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in darkness and thine obscurity be as the noonday and jehovah will guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in dry places and make strong thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not. and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in.  if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight [and] the holy of jehovah honorable and shalt honor it not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking [thine own] words then shalt thou delight thyself in jehovah and i will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and i will feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it. behold jehovahs hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you so that he will not hear. for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue muttereth wickedness. none sueth in righteousness and none pleadeth in truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. they hatch adders eggs and weave the spiders web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.  their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands. their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity desolation and destruction are in their paths. the way of peace they know not and there is no justice in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace. therefore is justice far from us neither doth righteousness overtake us we look for light but behold darkness for brightness but we walk in obscurity. we grope for the wall like the blind yea we grope as they that have no eyes we stumble at noonday as in the twilight among them that are lusty we are as dead men. we roar all like bears and moan sore like doves we look for justice but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us. for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them  transgressing and denying jehovah and turning away from following our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. and justice is turned away backward and righteousness standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and uprightness cannot enter. yea truth is lacking and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. and jehovah saw it and it displeased him that there was no justice. and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it upheld him. and he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a mantle. according to their deeds accordingly he will repay wrath to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense. so shall they fear the name of jehovah from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun for he will come as a rushing stream which the breath of jehovah driveth.  and a redeemer will come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith jehovah. and as for me this is my covenant with them saith jehovah my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith jehovah from henceforth and for ever. arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of jehovah is risen upon thee. for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the peoples but jehovah will arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee. and nations shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising. lift up thine eyes round about and see they all gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms. then thou shalt see and be radiant and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.  the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and frankincense and shall proclaim the praises of jehovah.  all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory. who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them for the name of jehovah thy god and for the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee. and foreigners shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favor have i had mercy on thee. thy gates also shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations and their kings led captive. for that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted.  the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the firtree the pine and the boxtree together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious. and the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of jehovah the zion of the holy one of israel.  whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man passed through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generations. thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i jehovah am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob. for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron. i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness. violence shall no more be heard in thy land desolation nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise.  the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory. thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for jehovah will be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified.  the little one shall become a thousand and the small one a strong nation i jehovah will hasten it in its time. the spirit of the lord jehovah is upon me because jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening [of the prison] to them that are bound to proclaim the year of jehovahs favor and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn  to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them a garland for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called trees of righteousness the planting of jehovah that he may be glorified. and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations. and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine dressers. but ye shall be named the priests of jehovah men shall call you the ministers of our god ye shall eat the wealth of the nations and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. instead of your shame [ye shall have] double and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess double everlasting joy shall be unto them. for i jehovah love justice i hate robbery with iniquity and i will give them their recompense in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them.  and their seed shall be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which jehovah hath blessed. i will greatly rejoice in jehovah my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. for as the earth bringeth forth its bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. for zions sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalems sake i will not rest until her righteousness go forth as brightness and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. and the nations shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of jehovah shall name. thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of jehovah and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god.  thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzi bah and thy land beulah for jehovah delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married. for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee. i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem they shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that are jehovahs remembrancers take ye no rest and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth. jehovah hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine for which thou hast labored but they that have garnered it shall eat it and praise jehovah and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary. go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up an ensign for the peoples.  behold jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his recompense before him. and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of jehovah and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken. who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel marching in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save. wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat i have trodden the winepress alone and of the peoples there was no man with me yea i trod them in mine anger and trampled them in my wrath and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments and i have stained all my raiment. for the day of vengeance was in my heart and the year of my redeemed is come. and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my wrath it upheld me.  and i trod down the peoples in mine anger and made them drunk in my wrath and i poured out their lifeblood on the earth. i will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of jehovah [and] the praises of jehovah according to all that jehovah hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. for he said surely they are my people children that will not deal falsely so he was their saviour. in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old. but they rebelled and grieved his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy [and] himself fought against them. then he remembered the days of old moses [and] his people [saying] where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit in the midst of them  that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of moses that divided the waters before them to make himself an everlasting name that led them through the depths as a horse in the wilderness so that they stumbled not as the cattle that go down into the valley the spirit of jehovah caused them to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name. look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts the yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me. for thou art our father though abraham knoweth us not and israel doth not acknowledge us thou o jehovah art our father our redeemer from everlasting is thy name. o jehovah why dost thou make us to err from thy ways and hardenest our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance. thy holy people possessed [it] but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. we are become as they over whom thou never barest rule as they that were not called by thy name.  oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might quake at thy presence as when fire kindleth the brushwood [and] the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presence when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains quaked at thy presence. for from of old men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen a god besides thee who worketh for him that waiteth for him. thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou wast wroth and we sinned in them [have we been] of long time and shall we be saved for we are all become as one that is unclean and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind take us away. and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.  but now o jehovah thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand. be not wroth very sore o jehovah neither remember iniquity for ever behold look we beseech thee we are all thy people. thy holy cities are become a wilderness zion is become a wilderness jerusalem a desolation. our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned with fire and all our pleasant places are laid waste. wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o jehovah wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore i am inquired of by them that asked not [for me] i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name. i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people that walk in a way that is not good after their own thoughts a people that provoke me to my face continually sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon bricks that sit among the graves and lodge in the secret places that eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels  that say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou. these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day. behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense yea i will recompense into their bosom your own iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith jehovah that have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i first measure their work into their bosom. thus saith jehovah as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sake that i may not destroy them all. and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and my chosen shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there. and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me. but ye that forsake jehovah that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for fortune and that fill up mingled wine unto destiny  i will destine you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes and chose that wherein i delighted not. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be put to shame behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall wail for vexation of spirit. and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen and the lord jehovah will slay thee and he will call his servants by another name so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes. for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind.  but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy. and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying. there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed. and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for calamity for they are the seed of the blessed of jehovah and their offspring with them. and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear.  the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and dust shall be the serpents food. they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool what manner of house will ye build unto me and what place shall be my rest for all these things hath my hand made and [so] all these things came to be saith jehovah but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at my word. he that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as he that breaketh a dogs neck he that offereth an oblation [as he that offereth] swines blood he that burneth frankincense as he that blesseth an idol. yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did that which was evil in mine eyes and chose that wherein i delighted not.  hear the word of jehovah ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hate you that cast you out for my names sake have said let jehovah be glorified that we may see your joy but it is they that shall be put to shame. a voice of tumult from the city a voice from the temple a voice of jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies. before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a manchild. who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall a land be born in one day shall a nation be brought forth at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children. shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith jehovah shall i that cause to bring forth shut [the womb] saith thy god. rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad for her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn over her that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.  for thus saith jehovah behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream and ye shall suck [thereof] ye shall be borne upon the side and shall be dandled upon the knees. as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem. and ye shall see [it] and your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass and the hand of jehovah shall be known toward his servants and he will have indignation against his enemies. for behold jehovah will come with fire and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind to render his anger with fierceness and his rebuke with flames of fire. for by fire will jehovah execute judgment and by his sword upon all flesh and the slain of jehovah shall be many. they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] unto the gardens behind one in the midst eating swines flesh and the abomination and the mouse they shall come to an end together saith jehovah.  for i [know] their works and their thoughts [the time] cometh that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and shall see my glory. and i will set a sign among them and i will send such as escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the nations. and they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto jehovah upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon dromedaries to my holy mountain jerusalem saith jehovah as the children of israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of jehovah. and of them also will i take for priests [and] for levites saith jehovah. for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith jehovah so shall your seed and your name remain. and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith jehovah.  and they shall go forth and look upon the dead bodies of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin to whom the word of jehovah came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign. it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month. now the word of jehovah came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee i have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations. then said i ah lord jehovah behold i know not how to speak for i am a child. but jehovah said unto me say not i am a child for to whomsoever i shall send thee thou shalt go and whatsoever i shall command thee thou shalt speak. be not afraid because of them for i am with thee to deliver thee saith jehovah.  then jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth and jehovah said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow to build and to plant. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying jeremiah what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almondtree. then said jehovah unto me thou hast well seen for i watch over my word to perform it. and the word of jehovah came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a boiling caldron and the face thereof is from the north. then jehovah said unto me out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith jehovah and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah.  and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness in that they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands. thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that i command thee be not dismayed at them lest i dismay thee before them. for behold i have made thee this day a fortified city and an iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land. and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith jehovah to deliver thee. and the word of jehovah came to me saying go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith jehovah i remember for thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals how thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown. israel [was] holiness unto jehovah the firstfruits of his increase all that devour him shall be held guilty evil shall come upon them saith jehovah.  hear ye the word of jehovah o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel thus saith jehovah what unrighteousness have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain neither said they where is jehovah that brought us up out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that none passed through and where no man dwelt and i brought you into a plentiful land to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination. the priests said not where is jehovah and they that handle the law knew me not the rulers also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not profit. wherefore i will yet contend with you saith jehovah and with your childrens children will i contend. for pass over to the isles of kittim and see and send unto kedar and consider diligently and see if there hath been such a thing.  hath a nation changed [its] gods which yet are no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith jehovah. for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water. is israel a servant is he a homeborn [slave] why is he become a prey the young lions have roared upon him and yelled and they have made his land waste his cities are burned up without inhabitant. the children also of memphis and tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head. hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast forsaken jehovah thy god when he led thee by the way and now what hast thou to do in the way to egypt to drink the waters of the shihor or what hast thou to do in the way to assyria to drink the waters of the river  thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter that thou hast forsaken jehovah thy god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord jehovah of hosts. for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bonds and thou saidst i will not serve for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself playing the harlot. yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me for though thou wash thee with lye and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord jehovah. how canst thou say i am not defiled i have not gone after the baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done [thou art] a swift dromedary traversing her ways a wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind in her desire in her occasion who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her.  withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst it is in vain no for i have loved strangers and after them will i go. as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets who say to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us. but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah. wherefore will ye contend with me ye all have transgressed against me saith jehovah. in vain have i smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion. o generation see ye the word of jehovah. have i been a wilderness unto israel or a land of thick darkness wherefore say my people we are broken loose we will come no more unto thee  can a virgin forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number. how trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways. also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor thou didst not find them breaking in but it is because of all these things. yet thou saidst i am innocent surely his anger is turned away from me. behold i will enter into judgment with thee because thou sayest i have not sinned. why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou shalt be ashamed of egypt also as thou wast ashamed of assyria. from thence also shalt thou go forth with thy hands upon thy head for jehovah hath rejected those in whom thou trustest and thou shalt not prosper with them. they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans will he return unto her again will not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith jehovah.  lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights and see where hast thou not been lain with by the ways hast thou sat for them as an arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain yet thou hast a harlots forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed. wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art the guide of my youth will he retain [his anger] for ever will he keep it to the end behold thou hast spoken and hast done evil things and hast had thy way. moreover jehovah said unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot. and i said after she had done all these things she will return unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it. and i saw when for this very cause that backsliding israel had committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement yet treacherous judah her sister feared not but she also went and played the harlot.  and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that the land was polluted and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks. and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith jehovah. and jehovah said unto me backsliding israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous judah. go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding israel saith jehovah i will not look in anger upon you for i am merciful saith jehovah i will not keep [anger] for ever. only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against jehovah thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith jehovah. return o backsliding children saith jehovah for i am a husband unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion and i will give you shepherds according to my heart who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.  and it shall come to pass when ye are multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith jehovah they shall say no more the ark of the covenant of jehovah neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they miss it neither shall it be made any more. at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of jehovah and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of jehovah to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i gave for an inheritance unto your fathers. but i said how i will put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations and i said ye shall call me my father and shall not turn away from following me. surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith jehovah.  a voice is heard upon the bare heights the weeping [and] the supplications of the children of israel because they have perverted their way they have forgotten jehovah their god. return ye backsliding children i will heal your backslidings. behold we are come unto thee for thou art jehovah our god. truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills the tumult on the mountains truly in jehovah our god is the salvation of israel. but the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters. let us lie down in our shame and let our confusion cover us for we have sinned against jehovah our god we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and we have not obeyed the voice of jehovah our god. if thou wilt return o israel saith jehovah if thou wilt return unto me and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not be removed  and thou shalt swear as jehovah liveth in truth in justice and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory. for thus saith jehovah to the men of judah and to jerusalem break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns. circumcise yourselves to jehovah and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my wrath go forth like fire and burn so that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings. declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye the trumpet in the land cry aloud and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities. set up a standard toward zion flee for safety stay not for i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction. a lion is gone up from his thicket and a destroyer of nations he is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate that thy cities be laid waste without inhabitant. for this gird you with sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of jehovah is not turned back from us.  and it shall come to pass at that day saith jehovah that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder. then said i ah lord jehovah surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the life. at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to winnow nor to cleanse a full wind from these shall come for me now will i also utter judgments against them. behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots [shall be] as the whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles. woe unto us for we are ruined. o jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved. how long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth evil from the hills of ephraim make ye mention to the nations behold publish against jerusalem [that] watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah.  as keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith jehovah. thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness for it is bitter for it reacheth unto thy heart. my anguish my anguish i am pained at my very heart my heart is disquieted in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war. destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is laid waste suddenly are my tents destroyed [and] my curtains in a moment. how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet for my people are foolish they know me not they are sottish children and they have no understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge. i beheld the earth and lo it was waste and void and the heavens and they had no light. i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved to and fro. i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled.  i beheld and lo the fruitful field was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of jehovah [and] before his fierce anger. for thus saith jehovah the whole land shall be a desolation yet will i not make a full end. for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and i have not repented neither will i turn back from it. every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they go into the thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city is forsaken and not a man dwelleth therein. and thou when thou art made desolate what wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with scarlet though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint in vain dost thou make thyself fair [thy] lovers despise thee they seek thy life. for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that gaspeth for breath that spreadeth her hands [saying] woe is me now for my soul fainteth before the murderers.  run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that doeth justly that seeketh truth and i will pardon her. and though they say as jehovah liveth surely they swear falsely. o jehovah do not thine eyes look upon truth thou hast stricken them but they were not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return. then i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of jehovah nor the law of their god i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they know the way of jehovah and the law of their god. but these with one accord have broken the yoke and burst the bonds. wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them a leopard shall watch against their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many [and] their backslidings are increased.  how can i pardon thee thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they committed adultery and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots houses. they were as fed horses roaming at large every one neighed after his neighbors wife. shall i not visit for these things saith jehovah and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this go ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her branches for they are not jehovahs. for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith jehovah. they have denied jehovah and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them. wherefore thus saith jehovah the god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour them.  lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel saith jehovah it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they say. their quiver is an open sepulchre they are all mighty men. and they shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread [which] thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall beat down thy fortified cities wherein thou trustest with the sword. but even in those days saith jehovah i will not make a full end with you. and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore hath jehovah our god done all these things unto us then shalt thou say unto them like as ye have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. declare ye this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah saying hear now this o foolish people and without understanding that have eyes and see not that have ears and hear not  fear ye not me saith jehovah will ye not tremble at my presence who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it. but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone. neither say they in their heart let us now fear jehovah our god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in its season that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good from you. for among my people are found wicked men they watch as fowlers lie in wait they set a trap they catch men. as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxed rich. they are waxed fat they shine yea they overpass in deeds of wickedness they plead not the cause the cause of the fatherless that they may prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge.  shall i not visit for these things saith jehovah shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this a wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof flee for safety ye children of benjamin out of the midst of jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and raise up a signal on beth haccherem for evil looketh forth from the north and a great destruction. the comely and delicate one the daughter of zion will i cut off. shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one in his place. prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon. woe unto us for the day declineth for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. arise and let us go up by night and let us destroy her palaces. for thus hath jehovah of hosts said hew ye down trees and cast up a mound against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.  as a well casteth forth its waters so she casteth forth her wickedness violence and destruction is heard in her before me continually is sickness and wounds. be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul be alienated from thee lest i make thee a desolation a land not inhabited. thus saith jehovah of hosts they shall thoroughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine turn again thy hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.  to whom shall i speak and testify that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of jehovah is become unto them a reproach they have no delight in it. therefore i am full of the wrath of jehovah i am weary with holding in pour it out upon the children in the street and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days. and their houses shall be turned unto others their fields and their wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith jehovah.  for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. they have healed also the hurt of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace. were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk [therein].  and i set watchmen over you [saying] hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken. therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is among them. hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words and as for my law they have rejected it.  to what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burntofferings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me. therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them the neighbor and his friend shall perish. thus saith jehovah behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. they lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses every one set in array as a man to the battle against thee o daughter of zion.  we have heard the report thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy [and] terror are on every side. o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.  i have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way. they are all grievous revolters going about with slanders they are brass and iron they all of them deal corruptly. the bellows blow fiercely the lead is consumed of the fire in vain do they go on refining for the wicked are not plucked away. refuse silver shall men them because jehovah hath rejected them. the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying stand in the gate of jehovahs house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of jehovah all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship jehovah. thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place. trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of jehovah the temple of jehovah the temple of jehovah are these. for if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor  if ye oppress not the sojourner the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your own hurt then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers from of old even for evermore. behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit. will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods that ye have not known and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered that ye may do all these abominations is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold i even i have seen it saith jehovah. but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i caused my name to dwell at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel. and now because ye have done all these works saith jehovah and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not  therefore will i do unto the house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i did to shiloh. and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim. therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee. seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger. do they provoke me to anger saith jehovah [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion of their own faces therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenched. thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel add your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat ye flesh.  for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices but this thing i commanded them saying hearken unto my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the way that i command you that it may be well with you. but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in [their own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart and went backward and not forward. since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but made their neck stiff they did worse than their fathers. and thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee. and thou shalt say unto them this is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of jehovah their god nor received instruction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth.  cut off thy hair [o jerusalem] and cast it away and take up a lamentation on the bare heights for jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. for the children of judah have done that which is evil in my sight saith jehovah they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it. and they have built the high places of topheth which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded not neither came it into my mind. therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that it shall no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in topheth till there be no place [to bury]. and the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth and none shall frighten them away. then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall become a waste.  at that time saith jehovah they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven which they have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked and which they have sought and which they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family that remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith jehovah of hosts. moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith jehovah shall men fall and not rise up again shall one turn away and not return why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return.  i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repenteth him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turneth to his course as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle. yea the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times and the turtle dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming but my people know not the law of jehovah. how do ye say we are wise and the law of jehovah is with us but behold the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely. the wise men are put to shame they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of jehovah and what manner of wisdom is in them therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall possess them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. and they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace.  were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith jehovah. i will utterly consume them saith jehovah there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the figtree and the leaf shall fade and [the things that] i have given them shall pass away from them. why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the fortified cities and let us be silent there for jehovah our god hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against jehovah. we looked for peace but no good came [and] for a time of healing and behold dismay the snorting of his horses is heard from dan at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein. for behold i will send serpents adders among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith jehovah.  oh that i could comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint within me. behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off is not jehovah in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with foreign vanities the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved. for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i mourn dismay hath taken hold on me. is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people oh that i had in the wilderness a lodgingplace of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they are all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men. and they bend their tongue [as it were] their bow for falsehood and they are grown strong in the land but not for truth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith jehovah.  take ye heed every one of his neighbor and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbor will go about with slanders. and they will deceive every one his neighbor and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies they weary themselves to commit iniquity. thy habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith jehovah. therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i will melt them and try them for how [else] should i do because of the daughter of my people their tongue is a deadly arrow it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth but in his heart he layeth wait for him. shall i not visit them for these things saith jehovah shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none passeth through neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled they are gone.  and i will make jerusalem heaps a dwellingplace of jackals and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without inhabitant. who is the wise man that may understand this and [who is] he to whom the mouth of jehovah hath spoken that he may declare it wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness so that none passeth through and jehovah saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the baalim which their fathers taught them therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink. i will scatter them also among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them. thus saith jehovah of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for the skilful women that they may come  and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters. for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we ruined we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because they have cast down our dwellings. yet hear the word of jehovah o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbor lamentation. for death is come up into our windows it is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without [and] the young men from the streets. speak thus saith jehovah the dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather [them]. thus saith jehovah let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he hath understanding and knoweth me that i am jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness justice and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith jehovah.  behold the days come saith jehovah that i will punish all them that are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off that dwell in the wilderness for all the nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in heart. hear ye the word which jehovah speaketh unto you o house of israel thus saith jehovah learn not the way of the nations and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the nations are dismayed at them. for the customs of the peoples are vanity for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not. they are like a palmtree of turned work and speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go. be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither is it in them to do good. there is none like unto thee o jehovah thou art great and thy name is great in might.  who should not fear thee o king of the nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their royal estate there is none like unto thee. but they are together brutish and foolish the instruction of idols it is but a stock. there is silver beaten into plates which is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith blue and purple for their clothing they are all the work of skilful men. but jehovah is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth trembleth and the nations are not able to abide his indignation. thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth these shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens. he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens when he uttereth his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.  every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them. they are vanity a work of delusion in the time of their visitation they shall perish. the portion of jacob is not like these for he is the former of all things and israel is the tribe of his inheritance jehovah of hosts is his name. gather up thy wares out of the land o thou that abidest in the siege. for thus saith jehovah behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will distress them that they may feel [it]. woe is me because of my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly this is [my] grief and i must bear it. my tent is destroyed and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth from me and they are not there is none to spread my tent any more and to set up my curtains. for the shepherds are become brutish and have not inquired of jehovah therefore they have not prospered and all their flocks are scattered.  the voice of tidings behold it cometh and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah a desolation a dwellingplace of jackals. o jehovah i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. o jehovah correct me but in measure not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing. pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have devoured jacob yea they have devoured him and consumed him and have laid waste his habitation. the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and say thou unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the iron furnace saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god  that i may establish the oath which i sware unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day. then answered i and said amen o jehovah. and jehovah said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them. for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice. yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart therefore i brought upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not. and jehovah said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem. they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear my words and they are gone after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers.  therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and they shall cry unto me but i will not hearken unto them. then shall the cities of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal. therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble. what hath my beloved to do in my house seeing she hath wrought lewdness [with] many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest. jehovah called thy name a green olivetree fair with goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken.  for jehovah of hosts who planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee because of the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto baal. and jehovah gave me knowledge of it and i knew it then thou showedst me their doings. but i was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me [saying] let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered. but o jehovah of hosts who judgest righteously who triest the heart and the mind i shall see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause. therefore thus saith jehovah concerning the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying thou shalt not prophesy in the name of jehovah that thou die not by our hand therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine  and there shall be no remnant unto them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation. righteous art thou o jehovah when i contend with thee yet would i reason the cause with thee wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their heart. but thou o jehovah knowest me thou seest me and triest my heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter. how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of the whole country wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our latter end. if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and though in a land of peace thou art secure yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the jordan  for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee even they have cried aloud after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee. i have forsaken my house i have cast off my heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. my heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest she hath uttered her voice against me therefore i have hated her. is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey are the birds of prey against her round about go ye assemble all the beasts of the field bring them to devour. many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. they have made it a desolation it mourneth unto me being desolate the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart. destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness for the sword of jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh hath peace.  they have sown wheat and have reaped thorns they have put themselves to pain and profit nothing and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits because of the fierce anger of jehovah. thus saith jehovah against all mine evil neighbors that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them up from off their land and will pluck up the house of judah from among them. and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them up i will return and have compassion on them and i will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land. and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name as jehovah liveth even as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built up in the midst of my people. but if they will not hear then will i pluck up that nation plucking up and destroying it saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah unto me go and buy thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water. so i bought a girdle according to the word of jehovah and put it upon my loins.  and the word of jehovah came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou hast bought which is upon thy loins and arise go to the euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock. so i went and hid it by the euphrates as jehovah commanded me. and it came to pass after many days that jehovah said unto me arise go to the euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there. then i went to the euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing. then the word of jehovah came unto me saying thus saith jehovah after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem. this evil people that refuse to hear my words that walk in the stubbornness of their heart and are gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is profitable for nothing.  for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith jehovah that they may be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear. therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith jehovah the god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine then shalt thou say unto them thus saith jehovah behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness. and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith jehovah i will not pity nor spare nor have compassion that i should not destroy them. hear ye and give ear be not proud for jehovah hath spoken. give glory to jehovah your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness.  but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret for [your] pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because jehovahs flock is taken captive. say thou unto the king and to the queenmother humble yourselves sit down for your headtires are come down even the crown of your glory. the cities of the south are shut up and there is none to open them judah is carried away captive all of it it is wholly carried away captive. lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock what wilt thou say when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee shall not sorrows take hold of thee as of a woman in travail and if thou say in thy heart wherefore are these things come upon me for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered and thy heels suffer violence. can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil. therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.  this is thy lot the portion measured unto thee from me saith jehovah because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood. therefore will i also uncover thy skirts upon thy face and thy shame shall appear. i have seen thine abominations even thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom on the hills in the field. woe unto thee o jerusalem thou wilt not be made clean how long shall it yet be the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah concerning the drought. judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they sit in black upon the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up. and their nobles send their little ones to the waters they come to the cisterns and find no water they return with their vessels empty they are put to shame and confounded and cover their heads. because of the ground which is cracked for that no rain hath been in the land the plowmen are put to shame they cover their heads. yea the hind also in the field calveth and forsaketh [her young] because there is no grass.  and the wild asses stand on the bare heights they pant for air like jackals their eyes fail because there is no herbage. though our iniquities testify against us work thou for thy names sake o jehovah for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee. o thou hope of israel the saviour thereof in the time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o jehovah art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not. thus saith jehovah unto this people even so have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore jehovah doth not accept them now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins. and jehovah said unto me pray not for this people for [their] good. when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and mealoffering i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence.  then said i ah lord jehovah behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place. then jehovah said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake i unto them they prophesy unto you a lying vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their own heart. therefore thus saith jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them. and thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous wound.  if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold they that are sick with famine for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge. hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul loathed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of healing and behold dismay we acknowledge o jehovah our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee. do not abhor [us] for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us. are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o jehovah our god therefore we will wait for thee for thou hast made all these things. then said jehovah unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind would not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth.  and it shall come to pass when they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith jehovah such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for captivity to captivity. and i will appoint over them four kinds saith jehovah the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy. and i will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem. for who will have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who will bemoan thee or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare thou hast rejected me saith jehovah thou art gone backward therefore have i stretched out my hand against thee and destroyed thee i am weary with repenting. and i have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land i have bereaved [them] of children i have destroyed my people they returned not from their ways.  their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday i have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly. she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been put to shame and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith jehovah. woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have not lent neither have men lent to me [yet] every one of them doth curse me. jehovah said verily i will strengthen thee for good verily i will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. can one break iron even iron from the north and brass thy substance and thy treasures will i give for a spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders. and i will make [them] to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon you.  o jehovah thou knowest remember me and visit me and avenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered reproach. thy words were found and i did eat them and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart for i am called by thy name o jehovah god of hosts. i sat not in the assembly of them that make merry nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation. why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful [brook] as waters that fail therefore thus saith jehovah if thou return then will i bring thee again that thou mayest stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth they shall return unto thee but thou shalt not return unto them. and i will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith jehovah. and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.  the word of jehovah came also unto me saying thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. for thus saith jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land they shall die grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth. for thus saith jehovah enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament neither bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith jehovah even lovingkindness and tender mercies. both great and small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them  neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. and thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink. for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place before your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. and it shall come to pass when thou shalt show this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against jehovah our god then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith jehovah and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law and ye have done evil more than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart so that ye hearken not unto me  therefore will i cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night for i will show you no favor. therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that it shall no more be said as jehovah liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but as jehovah liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the countries whither he had driven them. and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers. behold i will send for many fishers saith jehovah and they shall fish them up and afterward i will send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the clefts of the rocks. for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes. and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.  o jehovah my strength and my stronghold and my refuge in the day of affliction unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and shall say our fathers have inherited nought but lies [even] vanity and things wherein there is no profit. shall a man make unto himself gods which yet are no gods therefore behold i will cause them to know this once will i cause them to know my hand and my might and they shall know that my name is jehovah. the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron [and] with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the tablet of their heart and upon the horns of your altars whilst their children remember their altars and their asherim by the green trees upon the high hills. o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil [and] thy high places because of sin throughout all thy borders. and thou even of thyself shalt discontinue from thy heritage that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.  thus saith jehovah cursed is the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from jehovah. for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness a salt land and not inhabited.  blessed is the man that trusteth in jehovah and whose trust jehovah is. for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spreadeth out its roots by the river and shall not fear when heat cometh but its leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit. the heart is deceitful above all things and it is exceedingly corrupt who can know it i jehovah search the mind i try the heart even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings. as the partridge that sitteth on [eggs] which she hath not laid so is he that getteth riches and not by right in the midst of his days they shall leave him and at his end he shall be a fool. a glorious throne [set] on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.  o jehovah the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be put to shame. they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken jehovah the fountain of living waters. heal me o jehovah and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise.  behold they say unto me where is the word of jehovah let it come now. as for me i have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that which came out of my lips was before thy face. be not a terror unto me thou art my refuge in the day of evil. let them be put to shame that persecute me but let not me be put to shame let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction. thus said jehovah unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem  and say unto them hear ye the word of jehovah ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates thus saith jehovah take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i commanded your fathers.  but they hearkened not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear and might not receive instruction. and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith jehovah to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but to hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever.  and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the places round about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the lowland and from the hill country and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and mealofferings and frankincense and bringing [sacrifices of] thanksgiving unto the house of jehovah. but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched. the word which came to jeremiah from jehovah saying arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee to hear my words. then i went down to the potters house and behold he was making a work on the wheels. and when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it. then the word of jehovah came to me saying  o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith jehovah. behold as the clay in the potters hand so are ye in my hand o house of israel. at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it if that nation concerning which i have spoken turn from their evil i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them. and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if they do that which is evil in my sight that they obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them. now therefore speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith jehovah behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and amend your ways and your doings. but they say it is in vain for we will walk after our own devices and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.  therefore thus saith jehovah ask ye now among the nations who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing. shall the snow of lebanon fail from the rock of the field [or] shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up for my people have forgotten me they have burned incense to false [gods] and they have been made to stumble in their ways in the ancient paths to walk in bypaths in a way not cast up to make their land an astonishment and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and shake his head. i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will show them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity. then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet. come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words. give heed to me o jehovah and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.  shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul. remember how i stood before thee to speak good for them to turn away thy wrath from them. therefore deliver up their children to the famine and give them over to the power of the sword and let their wives become childless and widows and let their men be slain of death [and] their young men smitten of the sword in battle. let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet. yet jehovah thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thou with them in the time of thine anger. thus said jehovah go and buy a potters earthen bottle and [take] of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the gate harsith and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee  and say hear ye the word of jehovah o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle. because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods that they knew not they and their fathers and the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents and have built the high places of baal to burn their sons in the fire for burntofferings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that this place shall no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter. and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies will i give to be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.  and i will make this city an astonishment and a hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress wherewith their enemies and they that seek their life shall distress them. then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee and shalt say unto them thus saith jehovah of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury in topheth till there be no place to bury. thus will i do unto this place saith jehovah and to the inhabitants thereof even making this city as topheth and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah which are defiled shall be as the place of topheth even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drinkofferings unto other gods.  then came jeremiah from topheth whither jehovah had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of jehovahs house and said to all the people thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have made their neck stiff that they may not hear my words. now pashhur the son of immer the priest who was chief officer in the house of jehovah heard jeremiah prophesying these things. then pashhur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin which was in the house of jehovah. and it came to pass on the morrow that pashhur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks. then said jeremiah unto him jehovah hath not called thy name pashhur but magormissabib. for thus saith jehovah behold i will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive to babylon and shall slay them with the sword.  moreover i will give all the riches of this city and all the gains thereof and all the precious things thereof yea all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies and they shall make them a prey and take them and carry them to babylon. and thou pashhur and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and there shalt thou be buried thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsely. o jehovah thou hast persuaded me and i was persuaded thou art stronger than i and hast prevailed i am become a laughingstock all the day every one mocketh me. for as often as i speak i cry out i cry violence and destruction because the word of jehovah is made a reproach unto me and a derision all the day. and if i say i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones and i am weary with forbearing and i cannot [contain].  for i have heard the defaming of many terror on every side. denounce and we will denounce him [say] all my familiar friends they that watch for my fall peradventure he will be persuaded and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him. but jehovah is with me as a mighty one [and] a terrible therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be utterly put to shame because they have not dealt wisely even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten. but o jehovah of hosts that triest the righteous that seest the heart and the mind let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause. sing unto jehovah praise ye jehovah for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil doers. cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a manchild is born unto thee making him very glad. and let that man be as the cities which jehovah overthrew and repented not and let him hear a cry in the morning and shouting at noontime  because he slew me not from the womb and so my mother would have been my grave and her womb always great. wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame the word which came unto jeremiah from jehovah when king zedekiah sent unto him pashhur the son of malchijah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying inquire i pray thee of jehovah for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us peradventure jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us. then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah thus saith jehovah the god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans that besiege you without the walls and i will gather them into the midst of this city. and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in wrath and in great indignation.  and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence. and afterward saith jehovah i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people even such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy. and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith jehovah behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death. he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and passeth over to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey. for i have set my face upon this city for evil and not for good saith jehovah it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire. and touching the house of the king of judah hear ye the word of jehovah  o house of david thus saith jehovah execute justice in the morning and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor lest my wrath go forth like fire and burn so that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings. behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley [and] of the rock of the plain saith jehovah you that say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations and i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith jehovah and i will kindle a fire in her forest and it shall devour all that is round about her. thus said jehovah go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word and say hear the word of jehovah o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates. thus saith jehovah execute ye justice and righteousness and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the sojourner the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place.  for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people. but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith jehovah that this house shall become a desolation. for thus saith jehovah concerning the house of the king of judah thou art gilead unto me [and] the head of lebanon [yet] surely i will make thee a wilderness [and] cities which are not inhabited. and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire. and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbor wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this great city then they shall answer because they forsook the covenant of jehovah their god and worshipped other gods and served them. weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country.  for thus saith jehovah touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah who reigned instead of josiah his father [and] who went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more. but in the place whither they have led him captive there shall he die and he shall see this land no more. woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by injustice that useth his neighbors service without wages and giveth him not his hire that saith i will build me a wide house and spacious chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion. shalt thou reign because thou strivest to excel in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness then it was well with him. he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well. was not this to know me saith jehovah. but thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness and for shedding innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it.  therefore thus saith jehovah concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him [saying] ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him [saying] ah lord or ah his glory he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem. go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from abarim for all thy lovers are destroyed. i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear. this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voice. the wind shall feed all thy shepherds and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail as i live saith jehovah though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence  and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans. and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die. but to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return thither shall they not return. is this man coniah a despised broken vessel is he a vessel wherein none delighteth wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into the land which they know not o earth earth earth hear the word of jehovah. thus saith jehovah write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no more shall a man of his seed prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling in judah. woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith jehovah. therefore thus saith jehovah the god of israel against the shepherds that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith jehovah.  and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and multiply. and i will set up shepherds over them who shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall any be lacking saith jehovah. behold the days come saith jehovah that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and he shall reign as king and deal wisely and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called jehovah our righteousness. therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that they shall no more say as jehovah liveth who brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but as jehovah liveth who brought up and who led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all the countries whither i had driven them. and they shall dwell in their own land.  concerning the prophets. my heart within me is broken all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of jehovah and because of his holy words.  for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. and their course is evil and their might is not right for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith jehovah. wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith jehovah. and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied by baal and caused my people israel to err. in the prophets of jerusalem also i have seen a horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies and they strengthen the hands of evil doers so that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them become unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah.  therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.  thus saith jehovah of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they teach you vanity they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of jehovah. they say continually unto them that despise me jehovah hath said ye shall have peace and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say no evil shall come upon you. for who hath stood in the council of jehovah that he should perceive and hear his word who hath marked my word and heard it behold the tempest of jehovah [even his] wrath is gone forth yea a whirling tempest it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. the anger of jehovah shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly. i sent not these prophets yet they ran i spake not unto them yet they prophesied.  but if they had stood in my council then had they caused my people to hear my words and had turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings. am i a god at hand saith jehovah and not a god afar off  can any hide himself in secret places so that i shall not see him saith jehovah. do not i fill heaven and earth saith jehovah. i have heard what the prophets have said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed. how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor as their fathers forgat my name for baal. the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully. what is the straw to the wheat saith jehovah. is not my word like fire saith jehovah and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces therefore behold i am against the prophets saith jehovah that steal my words every one from his neighbor.  behold i am against the prophets saith jehovah that use their tongues and say he saith. behold i am against them that prophesy lying dreams saith jehovah and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their vain boasting yet i sent them not nor commanded them neither do they profit this people at all saith jehovah. and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of jehovah then shalt thou say unto them what burden i will cast you off saith jehovah. and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of jehovah i will even punish that man and his house. thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother what hath jehovah answered and what hath jehovah spoken and the burden of jehovah shall ye mention no more for every mans own word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of jehovah of hosts our god. thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath jehovah answered thee and what hath jehovah spoken  but if ye say the burden of jehovah therefore thus saith jehovah because ye say this word the burden of jehovah and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of jehovah therefore behold i will utterly forget you and i will cast you off and the city that i gave unto you and to your fathers away from my presence and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten. jehovah showed me and behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of jehovah after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the craftsmen and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon. one basket had very good figs like the figs that are firstripe and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten they were so bad. then said jehovah unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the bad very bad that cannot be eaten they are so bad. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying  thus saith jehovah the god of israel like these good figs so will i regard the captives of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for good. for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up. and i will give them a heart to know me that i am jehovah and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. and as the bad figs which cannot be eaten they are so bad surely thus saith jehovah so will i give up zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt i will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them. and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers.  the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah the same was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day these three and twenty years the word of jehovah hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising up early and speaking but ye have not hearkened. and jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear saying return ye now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers from of old and even for evermore and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands and i will do you no hurt.  yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith jehovah that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt. therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts because ye have not heard my words behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith jehovah and [i will send] unto nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and i will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual desolations. moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years. and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith jehovah for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and i will make it desolate for ever.  and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. for many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them even of them and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands. for thus saith jehovah the god of israel unto me take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it. and they shall drink and reel to and fro and be mad because of the sword that i will send among them. then took i the cup at jehovahs hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom jehovah had sent me [to wit] jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment a hissing and a curse as it is this day pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of the uz and all the kings of the philistines and ashkelon and gaza and ekron and the remnant of ashdod  edom and moab and the children of ammon and all the kings of tyre and all the kings of sidon and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea dedan and tema and buz and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after them. and thou shalt say unto them thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spew and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you. and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith jehovah of hosts ye shall surely drink. for lo i begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith jehovah of hosts.  therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them jehovah will roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he will mightily roar against his fold he will give a shout as they that tread [the grapes] against all the inhabitants of the earth. a noise shall come even to the end of the earth for jehovah hath a controversy with the nations he will enter into judgment with all flesh as for the wicked he will give them to the sword saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth. and the slain of jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the face of the ground. wail ye shepherds and cry and wallow [in ashes] ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel. and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape.  a voice of the cry of the shepherds and the wailing of the principal of the flock for jehovah layeth waste their pasture. and the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of jehovah. he hath left his covert as the lion for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing [sword] and because of his fierce anger. in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from jehovah saying thus saith jehovah stand in the court of jehovahs house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in jehovahs house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word. it may be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. and thou shalt say unto them thus saith jehovah if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you  to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i send unto you even rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. and the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of jehovah. and it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that jehovah had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him saying thou shalt surely die. why hast thou prophesied in the name of jehovah saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without inhabitant and all the people were gathered unto jeremiah in the house of jehovah. and when the princes of judah heard these things they came up from the kings house unto the house of jehovah and they sat in the entry of the new gate of jehovahs [house].  then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy of death for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears. then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. now therefore amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of jehovah your god and jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. but as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as is good and right in your eyes. only know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears. then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy of death for he hath spoken to us in the name of jehovah our god. then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying  micah the morashtite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and he spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith jehovah of hosts zion shall be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him to death did he not fear jehovah and entreat the favor of jehovah and jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus should we commit great evil against our own souls. and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of jehovah uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriathjearim and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah and when jehoiakim the king with all his mightymen and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when uriah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt [namely] elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt  and they fetched forth uriah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. but the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from jehovah saying thus saith jehovah to me make thee bonds and bars and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the children of ammon and to the king of tyre and to the king of sidon by the hand of the messengers that come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah and give them a charge unto their masters saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters i have made the earth the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and i give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.  and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field also have i given him to serve him. and all the nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the time of his own land come and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman. and it shall come to pass that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith jehovah with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand. but as for you hearken ye not to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreams nor to your soothsayers nor to your sorcerers that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish.  but the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him that [nation] will i let remain in their own land saith jehovah and they shall till it and dwell therein. and i spake to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live. why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of babylon and hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you. for i have not sent them saith jehovah but they prophesy falsely in my name that i may drive you out and that ye may perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you. also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith jehovah hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of jehovahs house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you.  hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city become a desolation but if they be prophets and if the word of jehovah be with them let them now make intercession to jehovah of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of jehovah and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon. for thus saith jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem yea thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that are left in the house of jehovah and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith jehovah then will i bring them up and restore them to this place.  and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azzur the prophet who was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of jehovah in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying thus speaketh jehovah of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon. within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of jehovahs house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried to babylon  and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went to babylon saith jehovah for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon. then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of jehovah even the prophet jeremiah said amen jehovah do so jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of jehovahs house and all them of the captivity from babylon unto this place.  nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence. the prophet that prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that jehovah hath truly sent him. then hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet jeremiahs neck and brake it. and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying thus saith jehovah even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. and the prophet jeremiah went his way.  then the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah after that hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying go and tell hananiah saying thus saith jehovah thou hast broken the bars of wood but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.  for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may served nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also. then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah jehovah hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will send thee away from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast spoken rebellion against jehovah. so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon  after that jeconiah the king and the queenmother and the eunuchs [and] the princes of judah and jerusalem and the craftsmen and the smiths were departed from jerusalem  by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel unto all the captivity whom i have caused to be carried away captive from jerusalem unto babylon build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them. take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters and multiply ye there and be not diminished. and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto jehovah for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets that are in the midst of you and your diviners deceive you neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith jehovah.  for thus saith jehovah after seventy years are accomplished for babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith jehovah thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you hope in your latter end. and ye shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you. and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart. and i will be found of you saith jehovah and i will turn again your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places wither i have driven you saith jehovah and i will bring you again unto the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive. because ye have said jehovah hath raised us up prophets in babylon thus saith jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and concerning all the people that dwell in this city your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity  thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so bad. and i will pursue after them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth to be an execration and an astonishment and a hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them because they have not hearkened to my words saith jehovah wherewith i sent unto them my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith jehovah. hear ye therefore the word of jehovah all ye of the captivity whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon. thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel concerning ahab the son of kolaiah and concerning zedekiah the son of maaseiah who prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes  and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of judah that are in babylon saying jehovah make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire because they have wrought folly in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbors wives and have spoken words in my name falsely which i commanded them not and i am he that knoweth and am witness saith jehovah. and concerning shemaiah the nehelamite thou shalt speak saying thus speaketh jehovah of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that there may be officers in the house of jehovah for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles. now therefore why hast thou not rebuked jeremiah of anathoth who maketh himself a prophet to you  forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in babylon saying [the captivity] is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet. then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah saying send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith jehovah concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he hath caused you to trust in a lie therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do unto my people saith jehovah because he hath spoken rebellion against jehovah. the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying thus speaketh jehovah the god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book. for lo the days come saith jehovah that i will turn again the captivity of my people israel and judah saith jehovah and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it.  and these are the words that jehovah spake concerning israel and concerning judah. for thus saith jehovah we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace. ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it. and it shall come to pass in that day saith jehovah of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more make him their bondman but they shall serve jehovah their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them. therefore fear thou not o jacob my servant saith jehovah neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be quiet and at ease and none shall make him afraid.  for i am with thee saith jehovah to save thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have scattered thee but i will not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. for thus saith jehovah thy hurt is incurable and thy wound grievous. there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines. all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the greatness of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased. why criest thou for thy hurt thy pain is incurable for the greatness of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee. therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey. for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith jehovah because they have called thee an outcast [saying] it is zion whom no man seeketh after.  thus saith jehovah behold i will turn again the captivity of jacobs tents and have compassion on his dwelling places and the city shall be builded upon its own hill and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner. and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small. their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them. and their prince shall be of themselves and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me saith jehovah. and ye shall be my people and i will be your god. behold the tempest of jehovah [even his] wrath is gone forth a sweeping tempest it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. the fierce anger of jehovah shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall understand it.  at that time saith jehovah will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people. thus saith jehovah the people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest. jehovah appeared of old unto me [saying] yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee. again will i build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall enjoy [the fruit thereof]. for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the hills of ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto jehovah our god. for thus saith jehovah sing with gladness for jacob and shout for the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o jehovah save thy people the remnant of israel.  behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth [and] with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall they return hither. they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn. hear the word of jehovah o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as shepherd doth his flock. for jehovah hath ransomed jacob and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. and they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow unto the goodness of jehovah to the grain and to the new wine and to the oil and to the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all.  then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance and the young men and the old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow. and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah a voice is heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rachel weeping for her children she refuseth to be comforted for her children because they are not. thus saith jehovah refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith jehovah and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. and there is hope for thy latter end saith jehovah and [thy] children shall come again to their own border. i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself [thus] thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke] turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art jehovah my god.  surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth. is ephraim my dear son is he a darling child for as often as i speak against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my heart yearneth for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith jehovah. set thee up waymarks make thee guideposts set thy heart toward the highway even the way by which thou wentest turn again o virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities. how long wilt thou go hither and thither o thou backsliding daughter for jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall encompass a man. thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel yet again shall they use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall bring again their captivity jehovah bless thee o habitation of righteousness o mountain of holiness. and judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together the husbandmen and they that go about with flocks.  for i have satiated the weary soul and every sorrowful soul have i replenished. upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me. behold the days come saith jehovah that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast. and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith jehovah. in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge. but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grapes his teeth shall be set on edge. behold the days come saith jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was a husband unto them saith jehovah.  but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith jehovah i will put my law in their inward parts and in their heart will i write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know jehovah for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith jehovah for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin will i remember no more. thus saith jehovah who giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night who stirreth up the sea so that the waves thereof roar jehovah of hosts is his name if these ordinances depart from before me saith jehovah then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. thus saith jehovah if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath then will i also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith jehovah.  behold the days come saith jehovah that the city shall be built to jehovah from the tower of hananel unto the gate of the corner. and the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill gareb and shall turn about unto goah. and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto jehovah it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever. the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar. now at that time the king of babylons army was besieging jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard which was in the king of judahs house. for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith jehovah behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it  and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes and he shall bring zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i visit him saith jehovah though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper and jeremiah said the word of jehovah came unto me saying behold hanamel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. so hanamel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of jehovah and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the land of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself. then i knew that this was the word of jehovah. and i bought the field that was in anathoth of hanamel mine uncles son and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver.  and i subscribed the deed and sealed it and called witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances. so i took the deed of the purchase both that which was sealed [according to] the law and custom and that which was open and i delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of mahseiah in the presence of hanamel mine uncles [son] and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the guard. and i charged baruch before them saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel take these deeds this deed of the purchase which is sealed and this deed which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days. for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land. now after i had delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto jehovah saying ah lord jehovah behold thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm there is nothing too hard for thee  who showest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god jehovah of hosts is his name  great in counsel and mighty in work whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings who didst set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day both in israel and among [other] men and madest thee a name as at this day and didst bring forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror and gavest them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.  behold the mounds they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it. and thou hast said unto me o lord jehovah buy thee the field for money and call witnesses whereas the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans.  then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah saying behold i am jehovah the god of all flesh is there anything too hard for me therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to anger.  for the children of israel and the children of judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith jehovah. for this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day that i should remove it from before my face because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem.  and they have turned unto me the back and not the face and though i taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it. and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin.  and now therefore thus saith jehovah the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it is given into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence behold i will gather them out of all the countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my wrath and in great indignation and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely and they shall be my people and i will be their god and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from following them to do them good and i will put my fear in their hearts that they may not depart from me. yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. for thus saith jehovah like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them.  and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans. men shall buy fields for money and subscribe the deeds and seal them and call witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the hillcountry and in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith jehovah. moreover the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard saying thus saith jehovah that doeth it jehovah that formeth it to establish it jehovah is his name call unto me and i will answer thee and will show thee great things and difficult which thou knowest not. for thus saith jehovah the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are broken down [to make a defence] against the mounds and against the sword  while [men] come to fight with the chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my wrath and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and i will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth. and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first. and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned against me and whereby they have transgressed against me. and [this city] shall be to me for a name of joy for a praise and for a glory before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that i procure unto it. thus saith jehovah yet again there shall be heard in this place whereof ye say it is waste without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast  the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that say give thanks to jehovah of hosts for jehovah is good for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever [and of them] that bring [sacrifices of] thanksgiving into the house of jehovah. for i will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah of hosts yet again shall there be in this place which is waste without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. in the cities of the hillcountry in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them saith jehovah. behold the days come saith jehovah that i will perform that good word which i have spoken concerning the house of israel and concerning the house of judah. in those days and at that time will i cause a branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.  in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is [the name] whereby she shall be called jehovah our righteousness. for thus saith jehovah david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to burn meal offerings and to do sacrifice continually. and the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah saying thus saith jehovah if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night so that there shall not be day and night in their season then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers. as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me. and the word of jehovah came to jeremiah saying  considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which jehovah did choose he hath cast them off thus do they despise my people that they should be no more a nation before them. thus saith jehovah if my covenant of day and night [stand] not if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth then will i also cast away the seed of jacob and of david my servant so that i will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and will have mercy on them. the word which came unto jeremiah from jehovah when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying thus saith jehovah the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith jehovah behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire  and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon. yet hear the word of jehovah o zedekiah king of judah thus saith jehovah concerning thee thou shalt not die by the sword thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings that were before thee so shall they make a burning for thee and they shall lament thee [saying] ah lord for i have spoken the word saith jehovah. then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem when the king of babylons army was fighting against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these [alone] remained of the cities of judah [as] fortified cities. the word that came unto jeremiah from jehovah after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them  that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant that is a hebrew or a hebrewess go free that none should make bondmen of them [to wit] of a jew his brother. and all the princes and all the people obeyed that had entered into the covenant that every one should let his man servant and every one his maidservant go free that none should make bondmen of them any more they obeyed and let them go but afterwards they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. therefore the word of jehovah came to jeremiah from jehovah saying thus saith jehovah the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage saying at the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a hebrew that hath been sold unto thee and hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear.  and ye were now turned and had done that which is right in mine eyes in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name but ye turned and profaned my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had let go free at their pleasure to return and ye brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. therefore thus saith jehovah ye have not hearkened unto me to proclaim liberty every man to his brother and every man to his neighbor behold i proclaim unto you a liberty saith jehovah to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth. and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land that passed between the parts of the calf  i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth. and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylons army that are gone away from you. behold i will command saith jehovah and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without inhabitant. the word which came unto jeremiah from jehovah in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of jehovah into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink. then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habazziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites  and i brought them into the house of jehovah into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah the man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the threshold. and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites bowls full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine. but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn. and we have obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons or our daughters nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us.  but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem. then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel go and say to the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith jehovah. the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed and unto this day they drink none for they obey their fathers commandment but i have spoken unto you rising up early and speaking and ye have not hearkened unto me. i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me.  forasmuch as the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me therefore thus saith jehovah the god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered. and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he commanded you therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from jehovah saying  take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day. it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin. then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of jehovah which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book. and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of jehovah therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of jehovah in the ears of the people in jehovahs house upon the fast day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities. it may be they will present their supplication before jehovah and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the wrath that jehovah hath pronounced against this people.  and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of jehovah in jehovahs house. now it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that all the people in jerusalem and all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem proclaimed a fast before jehovah. then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of jehovah in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the upper court at the entry of the new gate of jehovahs house in the ears of all the people. and when micaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of jehovah he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the princes were sitting there [to wit] elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes. then micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people.  therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come. so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them. and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears. so baruch read it in their ears. now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they turned in fear one toward another and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words. and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book. then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye are. and they went in to the king into the court but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and they told all the words in the ears of the king.  so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of the chamber of elishama the scribe. and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. now the king was sitting in the winterhouse in the ninth month and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him. and it came to pass when jehudi had read three or four leaves that [the king] cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. and they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words. moreover elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them. and the king commanded jerahmeel the kings son and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but jehovah hid them.  then the word of jehovah came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned. and concerning jehoiakim king of judah thou shalt say thus saith jehovah thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast therefore thus saith jehovah concerning jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost. and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not.  then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words.  and zedekiah the son of josiah reigned as king instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah. but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of jehovah which he spake by the prophet jeremiah. and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto jehovah our god for us. now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison. and pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that were besieging jerusalem heard tidings of them they brake up from jerusalem. then came the word of jehovah unto the prophet jeremiah saying  thus saith jehovah the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to inquire of me behold pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land.  and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and they shall take it and burn it with fire. thus saith jehovah deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart. for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yea would they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire. and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to receive his portion there in the midst of the people. and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he laid hold on jeremiah the prophet saying thou art falling away to the chaldeans.  then said jeremiah it is false i am not falling away to the chaldeans. but he hearkened not to him so irijah laid hold on jeremiah and brought him to the princes. and the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison. when jeremiah was come into the dungeon house and into the cells and jeremiah had remained there many days then zedekiah the king sent and fetched him and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from jehovah and jeremiah said there is. he said also thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon. moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah wherein have i sinned against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land  and now hear i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be presented before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there. then zedekiah the king commanded and they committed jeremiah into the court of the guard and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city was spent. thus jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. and shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashhur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashhur the son of malchijah heard the words that jeremiah spake unto all the people saying thus saith jehovah he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey and he shall live. thus saith jehovah this city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of babylon and he shall take it.  then the princes said unto the king let this man we pray thee be put to death forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt. and zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do anything against you. then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchijah the kings son that was in the court of the guard and they let down jeremiah with cords. and in the dungeon there was no water but mire and jeremiah sank in the mire. now when ebed melech the ethiopian a eunuch who was in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin ebedmelech went forth out of the kings house and spake to the king saying my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine for there is no more bread in the city.  then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die. so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence rags and wornout garments and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah. and ebed melech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these rags and worn out garments under thine armholes under the cords. and jeremiah did so. so they drew up jeremiah with the cords and took him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of jehovah and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me. then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel thou wilt not hearken unto me.  so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as jehovah liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith jehovah the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thy house. but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen away to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me. but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee. obey i beseech thee the voice of jehovah in that which i speak unto thee so it shall be well with thee and thy soul shall live. but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that jehovah hath showed me  behold all the women that are left in the king of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylons princes and those women shall say thy familiar friends have set thee on and have prevailed over thee [now that] thy feet are sunk in the mire they are turned away back. and they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die. but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there.  then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived. so jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that jerusalem was taken. and it came to pass when jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and besieged it in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month a breach was made in the city that all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate [to wit] nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rab saris nergal sharezer rab mag with all the rest of the princes of the king of babylon. and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah and all the men of war saw them then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden through the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out toward the arabah.  but the army of the chaldeans pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath and he gave judgment upon him. then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah. moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon. and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem. then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city the deserters also that fell away to him and the residue of the people that remained. but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people that had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying  take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushazban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the chief officers of the king of babylon they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the guard and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people. now the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard saying go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day. but i will deliver thee in that day saith jehovah and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. for i will surely save thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith jehovah.  the word which came to jeremiah from jehovah after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of jerusalem and judah that were carried away captive unto babylon. and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him jehovah thy god pronounced this evil upon this place and jehovah hath brought it and done according as he spake because ye have sinned against jehovah and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you. and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go thither go.  now while he was not yet gone back go back then [said he] to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present and let him go. then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poorest of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon then they came to gedaliah to mizpah [to wit] ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men.  and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you. as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to stand before the chaldeans that shall come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the children of ammon and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan then all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah  and said unto him dost thou know that baalis the king of the children of ammon hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to take thy life but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not. then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he take thy life that all the jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant of judah perish but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael. now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and [one of] the chief officers of the king and ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah. then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land.  ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him [to wit] with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there the men of war. and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it that there came men from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house of jehovah. and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam. and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them [and cast them] into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him. but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have stores hidden in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey. so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren.  now the pit wherein ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of gedaliah the same was that which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the children of ammon. but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon. now it came to pass that when all the people that were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad.  so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah turned about and came back and went unto johanan the son of kareah. but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the children of ammon. then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam [to wit] the men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought back from gibeon and they departed and dwelt in geruth chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor over the land. then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near  and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we pray thee our supplication be presented before thee and pray for us unto jehovah thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us that jehovah thy god may show us the way wherein we should walk and the thing that we should do. then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto jehovah your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing jehovah shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you. then they said to jeremiah jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us if we do not according to all the word wherewith jehovah thy god shall send thee to us. whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of jehovah our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of jehovah our god. and it came to pass after ten days that the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah.  then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest and said unto them thus saith jehovah the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you. be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith jehovah for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand. and i will grant you mercy that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land. but if ye say we will not dwell in this land so that ye obey not the voice of jehovah your god saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell now therefore hear ye the word of jehovah o remnant of judah thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel if ye indeed set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there  then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye are afraid shall follow hard after you there in egypt and there ye shall die.  so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them. for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more. jehovah hath spoken concerning you o remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have testified unto you this day. for ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls for ye sent me unto jehovah your god saying pray for us unto jehovah our god and according unto all that jehovah our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it  and i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of jehovah your god in anything for which he hath sent me unto you. now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.  and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of jehovah their god wherewith jehovah their god had sent him to them even all these words then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely jehovah our god hath not sent thee to say ye shall not go into egypt to sojourn there but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they may put us to death and carry us away captive to babylon. so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of jehovah to dwell in the land of judah.  but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of judah the men and the women and the children and the kings daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah and they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of jehovah and they came unto tahpanhes. then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah in tahpanhes saying take great stones in thy hand and hide them in mortar in the brickwork which is at the entry of pharaohs house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah and say unto them thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.  and he shall come and shall smite the land of egypt such as are for death [shall be given] to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword. and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captive and he shall array himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace. he shall also break the pillars of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of egypt shall he burn with fire. the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews that dwelt in the land of egypt that dwelt at migdol and at tahpanhes and at memphis and in the country of pathros saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense [and] to serve other gods that they knew not neither they nor ye nor your fathers.  howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing that i hate. but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods. wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as it is this day. therefore now thus saith jehovah the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye [this] great evil against your own souls to cut off from you man and woman infant and suckling out of the midst of judah to leave you none remaining in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye are gone to sojourn that ye may be cut off and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth  have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers. therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will set my face against you for evil even to cut off all judah. and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed in the land of egypt shall they fall they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration [and] an astonishment and a curse and a reproach. for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence  so that none of the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or be left to return into the land of judah to which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return save such as shall escape. then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great assembly even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answered jeremiah saying as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of jehovah we will not hearken unto thee. but we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil. but since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drinkofferings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.  and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her without our husbands then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women even to all the people that had given him that answer saying the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not jehovah remember them and came it not into his mind so that jehovah could not longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land become a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without inhabitant as it is this day. because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against jehovah and have not obeyed the voice of jehovah nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as it is this day.  moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women hear the word of jehovah all judah that are in the land of egypt thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel saying ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and with your hands have fulfilled it saying we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her establish then your vows and perform your vows. therefore hear ye the word of jehovah all judah that dwell in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith jehovah that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying as the lord jehovah liveth. behold i watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them. and they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah few in number and all the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know whose word shall stand mine or theirs.  and this shall be the sign unto you saith jehovah that i will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil thus saith jehovah behold i will give pharaoh hophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon who was his enemy and sought his life. the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah when he wrote these word in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying thus saith jehovah the god of israel unto thee o baruch thou didst say woe is me now for jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain i am weary with my groaning and i find no rest. thus shalt thou say unto him thus saith jehovah behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up and this in the whole land.  and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith jehovah but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest. the word of jehovah which came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. of egypt concerning the army of pharaoh neco king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah. prepare ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle. harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears put on the coats of mail. wherefore have i seen it they are dismayed and are turned backward and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not back terror is on every side saith jehovah. let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape in the north by the river euphrates have they stumbled and fallen. who is this that riseth up like the nile whose waters toss themselves like the rivers  egypt riseth up like the nile and his waters toss themselves like the rivers and he saith i will rise up i will cover the earth i will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof. go up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men go forth cush and put that handle the shield and the ludim that handle and bend the bow. for that day is [a day] of the lord jehovah of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and be satiate and shall drink its fill of their blood for the lord jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates. go up into gilead and take balm o virgin daughter of egypt in vain dost thou use many medicines there is no healing for thee. the nations have heard of thy shame and the earth is full of thy cry for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty they are fallen both of them together. the word that jehovah spake to jeremiah the prophet how that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt.  declare ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in memphis and in tahpanhes say ye stand forth and prepare thee for the sword hath devoured round about thee. why are thy strong ones swept away they stood not because jehovah did drive them. he made many to stumble yea they fell one upon another and they said arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing sword. they cried there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath let the appointed time pass by. as i live saith the king whose name is jehovah of hosts surely like tabor among the mountains and like carmel by the sea so shall he come. o thou daughter that dwellest in egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for memphis shall become a desolation and shall be burnt up without inhabitant. egypt is a very fair heifer [but] destruction out of the north is come it is come. also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall for they also are turned back they are fled away together they did not stand for the day of their calamity is come upon them the time of their visitation.  the sound thereof shall go like the serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood. they shall cut down her forest saith jehovah though it cannot be searched because they are more than the locusts and are innumerable. the daughter of egypt shall be put to shame she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. jehovah of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will punish amon of no and pharaoh and egypt with her gods and her kings even pharaoh and them that trust in him and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterwards it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith jehovah. but fear not thou o jacob my servant neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be quiet and at ease and none shall make him afraid.  fear not thou o jacob my servant saith jehovah for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza. thus saith jehovah behold waters rise up out of the north and shall become an overflowing stream and shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein and the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail. at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones at the rushing of his chariots at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands because of the day that cometh to destroy all the philistines to cut off from tyre and sidon every helper that remaineth for jehovah will destroy the philistines the remnant of the isle of caphtor. baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is brought to nought the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself  o thou sword of jehovah how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be still. how canst thou be quiet seeing jehovah hath given thee a charge against ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed it. of moab. thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel woe unto nebo for it is laid waste kiriathaim is put to shame it is taken misgab is put to shame and broken down. the praise of moab is no more in heshbon they have devised evil against her come and let us cut her off from being a nation. thou also o madmen shalt be brought to silence the sword shall pursue thee. the sound of a cry from horonaim desolation and great destruction moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. for by the ascent of luhith with continual weeping shall they go up for at the descent of horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction. flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness. for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou also shalt be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity his priests and his princes together.  and the destroyer shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as jehovah hath spoken. give wings unto moab that she may fly and get her away and her cities shall become a desolation without any to dwell therein. cursed be he that doeth the work of jehovah negligently and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remaineth in him and his scent is not changed. therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that i will send unto him them that pour off and they shall pour him off and they shall empty his vessels and break their bottles in pieces. and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence. how say ye we are mighty men and valiant men for the war  moab is laid waste and they are gone up into his cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is jehovah of hosts. the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fast. all ye that are round about him bemoan him and all ye that know his name say how is the strong staff broken the beautiful rod o thou daughter that dwellest in dibon come down from thy glory and sit in thirst for the destroyer of moab is come up against thee he hath destroyed thy strongholds. o inhabitant of aroer stand by the way and watch ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth say what hath been done moab is put to shame for it is broken down wail and cry tell ye it by the arnon that moab is laid waste. and judgment is come upon the plain country upon holon and upon jahzah and upon mephaath and upon dibon and upon nebo and upon beth diblathaim and upon kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon beth meon and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near.  the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith jehovah. make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against jehovah and moab shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision. for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for as often as thou speakest of him thou waggest the head. o ye inhabitants of moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest over the mouth of the abyss. we have heard of the pride of moab [that] he is very proud his loftiness and his pride and his arrogancy and the haughtiness of his heart. i know his wrath saith jehovah that it is nought his boastings have wrought nothing.  therefore will i wail for moab yea i will cry out for all moab for the men of kir heres shall they mourn. with more than the weeping of jazer will i weep for thee o vine of sibmah thy branches passed over the sea they reached even to the sea of jazer upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the destroyer is fallen.  and gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of moab and i have caused wine to cease from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting the shouting shall be no shouting. from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh even unto jahaz have they uttered their voice from zoar even unto horonaim to eglath shelishiyah for the waters of nimrim also shall become desolate. moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith jehovah him that offereth in the high place and him that burneth incense to his gods. therefore my heart soundeth for moab like pipes and my heart soundeth like pipes for the men of kirheres therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished. for every head is bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands are cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth. on all the housetops of moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein none delighteth saith jehovah.  how is it broken down [how] do they wail how hath moab turned the back with shame so shall moab become a derision and a terror to all that are round about him.  for thus saith jehovah behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread out his wings against moab. kerioth is taken and the strongholds are seized and the heart of the mighty men of moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against jehovah. fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of moab saith jehovah. he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i will bring upon him even upon moab the year of their visitation saith jehovah. they that fled stand without strength under the shadow of heshbon for a fire is gone forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and hath devoured the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.  woe unto thee o moab the people of chemosh is undone for thy sons are taken away captive and thy daughters into captivity. yet will i bring back the captivity of moab in the latter days saith jehovah. thus far is the judgment of moab.  of the children of ammon. thus saith jehovah hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth malcam possess gad and his people well in the cities thereof therefore behold the days come saith jehovah that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard against rabbah of the children of ammon and it shall become a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel possess them that did possess him saith jehovah. wail o heshbon for ai is laid waste cry ye daughters of rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro among the fences for malcam shall go into captivity his priests and his princes together. wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures [saying] who shall come unto me behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the lord jehovah of hosts from all that are round about thee and ye shall be driven out every man right forth and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives. but afterward i will bring back the captivity of the children of ammon saith jehovah.  of edom. thus saith jehovah of hosts is wisdom no more in teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom vanished flee ye turn back dwell in the depths o inhabitants of dedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that i shall visit him. if grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes if thieves by night would they not destroy till they had enough but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is destroyed and his brethren and his neighbors and he is not. leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me. for thus saith jehovah behold they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink. for i have sworn by myself saith jehovah that bozrah shall become an astonishment a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.  i have heard tidings from jehovah and an ambassador is sent among the nations [saying] gather yourselves together and come against her and rise up to the battle. for behold i have made thee small among the nations and despised among men. as for thy terribleness the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith jehovah. and edom shall become an astonishment every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof saith jehovah no man shall dwell there neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. behold he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the jordan against the strong habitation for i will suddenly make them run away from it and whoso is chosen him will i appoint over it for who is like me and who will appoint me a time and who is the shepherd that will stand before me  therefore hear ye the counsel of jehovah that he hath taken against edom and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely they shall drag them away [even] the little ones of the flock surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. the earth trembleth at the noise of their fall there is a cry the noise whereof is heard in the red sea. behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread out his wings against bozrah and the heart of the mighty men of edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. of damascus. hamath is confounded and arpad for they have heard evil tidings they are melted away there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quiet. damascus is waxed feeble she turneth herself to flee and trembling hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her as of a woman in travail. how is the city of praise not forsaken the city of my joy therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day saith jehovah of hosts.  and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall devour the palaces of ben hadad. of kedar and of the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote. thus saith jehovah arise ye go up to kedar and destroy the children of the east. their tents and their flocks shall they take they shall carry away for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels and they shall cry unto them terror on every side flee ye wander far off dwell in the depths o ye inhabitants of hazor saith jehovah for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against you. arise get you up unto a nation that is at ease that dwelleth without care saith jehovah that have neither gates nor bars that dwell alone. and their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their cattle a spoil and i will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners [of their hair] cut off and i will bring their calamity from every side of them saith jehovah. and hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals a desolation for ever no man shall dwell there neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.  the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i will break the bow of elam the chief of their might. and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come. and i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger saith jehovah and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them and i will set my throne in elam and will destroy from thence king and princes saith jehovah. but it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring back the captivity of elam saith jehovah. the word that jehovah spake concerning babylon concerning the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet.  declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is put to shame merodach is dismayed her images are put to shame her idols are dismayed. for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they are fled they are gone both man and beast. in those days and in that time saith jehovah the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together they shall go on their way weeping and shall seek jehovah their god. they shall inquire concerning zion with their faces thitherward [saying] come ye and join yourselves to jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. my people have been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplace.  all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we are not guilty because they have sinned against jehovah the habitation of righteousness even jehovah the hope of their fathers. flee out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks. for lo i will stir up and cause to come up against babylon a company of great nations from the north country and they shall set themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man none shall return in vain. and chaldea shall be a prey all that prey upon her shall be satisfied saith jehovah. because ye are glad because ye rejoice o ye that plunder my heritage because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out [the grain] and neigh as strong horses your mother shall be utterly put to shame she that bare you shall be confounded behold she shall be the hindermost of the nations a wilderness a dry land and a desert.  because of the wrath of jehovah she shall not be inhabited but she shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues. set yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against jehovah. shout against her round about she hath submitted herself her bulwarks are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of jehovah take vengeance upon her as she hath done do unto her. cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own land. israel is a hunted sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of assyria devoured him and now at last nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones. therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have punished the king of assyria.  and i will bring israel again to his pasture and he shall feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of ephraim and in gilead. in those days and in that time saith jehovah the iniquity of israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i leave as a remnant. go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the inhabitants of pekod slay and utterly destroy after them saith jehovah and do according to all that i have commanded thee. a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction. how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how is babylon become a desolation among the nations i have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against jehovah. jehovah hath opened his armory and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for the lord jehovah of hosts hath a work [to do] in the land of the chaldeans.  come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be left. slay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them for their day is come the time of their visitation. the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon to declare in zion the vengeance of jehovah our god the vengeance of his temple. call together the archers against babylon all them that bend the bow encamp against her round about let none thereof escape recompense her according to her work according to all that she hath done do unto her for she hath been proud against jehovah against the holy one of israel. therefore shall her young men fall in her streets and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day saith jehovah. behold i am against thee o thou proud one saith the lord jehovah of hosts for thy day is come the time that i will visit thee. and the proud one shall stumble and fall and none shall raise him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour all that are round about him.  thus saith jehovah of hosts the children of israel and the children of judah are oppressed together and all that took them captive hold them fast they refuse to let them go. their redeemer is strong jehovah of hosts is his name he will thoroughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the earth and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon. a sword is upon the chaldeans saith jehovah and upon the inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men. a sword is upon the boasters and they shall become fools a sword is upon her mighty men and they shall be dismayed. a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbed. a drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it is a land of graven images and they are mad over idols. therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there and the ostriches shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.  as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof saith jehovah so shall no man dwell there neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. behold a people cometh from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. they lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses every one set in array as a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon. the king of babylon hath heard the tidings of them and his hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of him [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. behold [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from the pride of the jordan against the strong habitation for i will suddenly make them run away from it and whoso is chosen him will i appoint over it for who is like me and who will appoint me a time and who is the shepherd that can stand before me  therefore hear ye the counsel of jehovah that he hath taken against babylon and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans surely they shall drag them away [even] the little ones of the flock surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth trembleth and the cry is heard among the nations. thus saith jehovah behold i will raise up against babylon and against them that dwell in leb kamai a destroying wind. and i will send unto babylon strangers that shall winnow her and they shall empty her land for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. against [him that] bendeth let the archer bend his bow and against [him that] lifteth himself up in his coat of mail and spare ye not her young men destroy ye utterly all her host. and they shall fall down slain in the land of the chaldeans and thrust through in her streets. for israel is not forsaken nor judah of his god of jehovah of hosts though their land is full of guilt against the holy one of israel.  flee out of the midst of babylon and save every man his life be not cut off in her iniquity for it is the time of jehovahs vengeance he will render unto her a recompense. babylon hath been a golden cup in jehovahs hand that made all the earth drunken the nations have drunk of her wine therefore the nations are mad. babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed wail for her take balm for her pain if so be she may be healed. we would have healed babylon but she is not healed forsake her and let us go every one into his own country for her judgment reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies. jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness come and let us declare in zion the work of jehovah our god. make sharp the arrows hold firm the shields jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the medes because his purpose is against babylon to destroy it for it is the vengeance of jehovah the vengeance of his temple.  set up a standard against the walls of babylon make the watch strong set the watchmen prepare the ambushes for jehovah hath both purposed and done that which he spake concerning the inhabitants of babylon. o thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures thine end is come the measure of thy covetousness. jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself [saying] surely i will fill thee with men as with the canker worm and they shall lift up a shout against thee. he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens when he uttereth his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge every goldsmith is put to shame by his image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them. they are vanity a work of delusion in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  the portion of jacob is not like these for he is the former of all things and [israel] is the tribe of his inheritance jehovah of hosts is his name. thou art my battleaxe and weapons of war and with thee will i break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein and with thee will i break in pieces man and woman and with thee will i break in pieces the old man and the youth and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the virgin and with thee will i break in pieces the shepherd and his flock and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke [of oxen] and with thee will i break in pieces governors and deputies. and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight saith jehovah. behold i am against thee o destroying mountain saith jehovah which destroyest all the earth and i will stretch out my hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountain.  and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever saith jehovah. set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashkenaz appoint a marshal against her cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm.  prepare against her the nations the kings of the medes the governors thereof and all the deputies thereof and all the land of their dominion. and the land trembleth and is in pain for the purposes of jehovah against babylon do stand to make the land of babylon a desolation without inhabitant. the mighty men of babylon have forborne to fight they remain in their strongholds their might hath failed they are become as women her dwellingplaces are set on fire her bars are broken. one post shall run to meet another and one messenger to met another to show the king of babylon that his city is taken on every quarter  and the passages are seized and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted. for thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor at the time when it is trodden yet a little while and the time of harvest shall come for her. nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me he hath crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath like a monster swallowed me up he hath filled his maw with my delicacies he hath cast me out.  the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall the inhabitant of zion say and my blood be upon the inhabitants of chaldea shall jerusalem say. therefore thus saith jehovah behold i will plead thy cause and take vengeance for thee and i will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry. and babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for jackals an astonishment and a hissing without inhabitant. they shall roar together like young lions they shall growl as lions whelps.  when they are heated i will make their feast and i will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith jehovah. i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams with he goats. how is sheshach taken and the praise of the whole earth seized how is babylon become a desolation among the nations the sea is come up upon babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. her cities are become a desolation a dry land and a desert a land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  and i will execute judgment upon bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not flow any more unto him yea the wall of babylon shall fall. my people go ye out of the midst of her and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of jehovah. and let not your heart faint neither fear ye for the tidings that shall be heard in the land for tidings shall come one year and after that in another year [shall come] tidings and violence in the land ruler against ruler.  therefore behold the days come that i will execute judgment upon the graven images of babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. then the heavens and the earth and all that is therein shall sing for joy over babylon for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north saith jehovah. as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the land. ye that have escaped the sword go ye stand not still remember jehovah from afar and let jerusalem come into your mind. we are confounded because we have heard reproach confusion hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of jehovahs house. wherefore behold the days come saith jehovah that i will execute judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groan. though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall destroyers come unto her saith jehovah. the sound of a cry from babylon and of great destruction from the land of the chaldeans  for jehovah layeth babylon waste and destroyeth out of her the great voice and their waves roar like many waters the noise of their voice is uttered for the destroyer is come upon her even upon babylon and her mighty men are taken their bows are broken in pieces for jehovah is a god of recompenses he will surely requite. and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her governors and her deputies and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is jehovah of hosts. thus saith jehovah of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly overthrown and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the peoples shall labor for vanity and the nations for the fire and they shall be weary. the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah the son of mahseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his reign. now seraiah was chief chamberlain. and jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written concerning babylon.  and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon then see that thou read all these words and say o jehovah thou hast spoken concerning this place to cut it off that none shall dwell therein neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for ever. and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the euphrates and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise again because of the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary. thus far are the words of jeremiah. zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah. and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah according to all that jehoiakim had done. for through the anger of jehovah did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence. and zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon.  and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and encamped against it and they built forts against it round about. so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah. in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land. then a breach was made in the city and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were against the city round about and they went toward the arabah. but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him. then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath and he gave judgment upon him. and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah.  and he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon bound him in fetters and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death. now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard who stood before the king of babylon into jerusalem and he burned the house of jehovah and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burned he with fire. and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about. then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people and the residue of the people that were left in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the residue of the multitude. but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.  and the pillars of brass that were in the house of jehovah and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of jehovah did the chaldeans break in pieces and carried all the brass of them to babylon. the pots also and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away. and the cups and the firepans and the basins and the pots and the candlesticks and the spoons and the bowls that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away. the two pillars the one sea and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases which king solomon had made for the house of jehovahthe brass of all these vessels was without weight. and as for the pillars the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and a line of twelve cubits did compass it and the thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow. and a capital of brass was upon it and the height of the one capital was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about all of brass and the second pillar also had like unto these and pomegranates.  and there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about. and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and seven men of them that saw the kings face that were found in the city and the scribe of the captain of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city. and nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah. and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath. so judah was carried away captive out of his land. this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons  in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah and brought him forth out of prison and he spake kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon and changed his prison garments. and [jehoiachin] did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life and for his allowance there was a continual allowance given him by the king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all the days of his life. how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people she is become as a widow that was great among the nations she that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary  she weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they are become her enemies. judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of great servitude she dwelleth among the nations she findeth no rest all her persecutors overtook her within the straits. the ways of zion do mourn because none come to the solemn assembly all her gates are desolate her priests do sigh her virgins are afflicted and she herself is in bitterness. her adversaries are become the head her enemies prosper for jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary. and from the daughter of zion all her majesty is departed her princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.  jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old when her people fell into the hand of the adversary and none did help her the adversaries saw her they did mock at her desolations. jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is become as an unclean thing all that honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yea she sigheth and turneth backward. her filthiness was in her skirts she remembered not her latter end therefore is she come down wonderfully she hath no comforter behold o jehovah my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself. the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things for she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly. all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul see o jehovah and behold for i am become abject.  is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is brought upon me wherewith jehovah hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger. from on high hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand they are knit together they are come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to fail the lord hath delivered me into their hands against whom i am not able to stand. the lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me he hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men the lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of judah. for these things i weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy hath prevailed.  zion spreadeth forth her hands there is none to comfort her jehovah hath commanded concerning jacob that they that are round about him should be his adversaries jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing. jehovah is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment hear i pray you all ye peoples and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. i called for my lovers [but] they deceived me my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought them food to refresh their souls. behold o jehovah for i am in distress my heart is troubled my heart is turned within me for i have grievously rebelled abroad the sword bereaveth at home there is as death. they have heard that i sigh there is none to comfort me all mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed and they shall be like unto me. let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are many and my heart is faint.  how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger he hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel and hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof. he hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of israel he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he hath burned up jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about. he hath bent his bow like an enemy he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary and hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye in the tent of the daughter of zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire. the lord is become as an enemy he hath swallowed up israel he hath swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strongholds and he hath multiplied in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation.  and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his place of assembly jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. the lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces they have made a noise in the house of jehovah as in the day of a solemn assembly. jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion he hath stretched out the line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying and he hath made the rampart and wall to lament they languish together. her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bars her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not yea her prophets find no vision from jehovah. the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground they keep silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.  mine eyes do fail with tears my heart is troubled my liver is poured upon the earth because of the destruction of the daughter of my people because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. they say to their mothers where is grain and wine when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul is poured out into their mothers bosom. what shall i testify unto thee what shall i liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem what shall i compare to thee that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heal thee thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions and they have not uncovered thine iniquity to bring back thy captivity but have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment. all that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem [saying] is this the city that men called the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth  all thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee they hiss and gnash the teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it. jehovah hath done that which he purposed he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries. their heart cried unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no respite let not the apple of thine eye cease. arise cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the lord lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger at the head of every street. see o jehovah and behold to whom thou hast done thus shall the women eat their fruit the children that are dandled in the hands shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord  the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger thou hast slaughtered [and] not pitied. thou hast called as in the day of a solemn assembly my terrors on every side and there was none that escaped or remained in the day of jehovahs anger those that i have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. he hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light. surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day. my flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bones. he hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and travail. he hath made me to dwell in dark places as those that have been long dead. he hath walled me about that i cannot go forth he hath made my chain heavy. yea when i cry and call for help he shutteth out my prayer. he hath walled up my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths crooked.  he is unto me as a bear lying in wait as a lion in secret places.  he hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath made me desolate. he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow. he hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins. i am become a derision to all my people and their song all the day. he hath filled me with bitterness he hath sated me with wormwood. he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered me with ashes. and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace i forgat prosperity. and i said my strength is perished and mine expectation from jehovah. remember mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall. my soul hath them still in remembrance and is bowed down within me. this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope. [it is of] jehovahs lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not. they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness. jehovah is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him. jehovah is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him. it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of jehovah.  it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. let him sit alone and keep silence because he hath laid it upon him. let him put his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope. let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him let him be filled full with reproach. for the lord will not cast off for ever. for though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. to crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not. who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not out of the mouth of the most high cometh there not evil and good wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins let us search and try our ways and turn again to jehovah. let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens. we have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned.  thou hast covered with anger and pursued us thou hast slain thou hast not pitied.  thou hast covered thyself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through. thou hast made us an off scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. fear and the pit are come upon us devastation and destruction. mine eye runneth down with streams of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. mine eye poureth down and ceaseth not without any intermission till jehovah look down and behold from heaven. mine eye affecteth my soul because of all the daughters of my city. they have chased me sore like a bird they that are mine enemies without cause. they have cut off my life in the dungeon and have cast a stone upon me. waters flowed over my head i said i am cut off. i called upon thy name o jehovah out of the lowest dungeon. thou heardest my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry. thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee thou saidst fear not.  o lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast redeemed my life. o jehovah thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause. thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. thou hast heard their reproach o jehovah and all their devices against me the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day. behold thou their sitting down and their rising up i am their song. thou wilt render unto them a recompense o jehovah according to the work of their hands. thou wilt give them hardness of heart thy curse unto them. thou wilt pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of jehovah. how is the gold become dim [how] is the most pure gold changed the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street. the precious sons of zion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter even the jackals draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the ostriches in the wilderness.  the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto them. they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hands were laid upon her. her nobles were purer than snow they were whiter than milk they were more ruddy in body than rubies their polishing was as of sapphire. their visage is blacker than a coal they are not known in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it is become like a stick. they that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. jehovah hath accomplished his wrath he hath poured out his fierce anger and he hath kindled a fire in zion which hath devoured the foundations thereof.  the kings of the earth believed not neither all the inhabitants of the world that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of jerusalem. [it is] because of the sins of her prophets [and] the iniquities of her priests that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. they wander as blind men in the streets they are polluted with blood so that men cannot touch their garments. depart ye they cried unto them unclean depart depart touch not when they fled away and wandered men said among the nations they shall no more sojourn [here]. the anger of jehovah hath scattered them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favored not the elders. our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. they hunt our steps so that we cannot go in our streets our end is near our days are fulfilled for our end is come. our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens they chased us upon the mountains they laid wait for us in the wilderness.  the breath of our nostrils the anointed of jehovah was taken in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the nations. rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in the land of uz the cup shall pass through unto thee also thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself naked. the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished o daughter of zion he will no more carry thee away into captivity he will visit thine iniquity o daughter of edom he will uncover thy sins. remember o jehovah what is come upon us behold and see our reproach. our inheritance is turned unto strangers our houses unto aliens. we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows. we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us. our pursuers are upon our necks we are weary and have no rest. we have given the hand to the egyptians and to the assyrians to be satisfied with bread. our fathers sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquities. servants rule over us there is none to deliver us out of their hand. we get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.  our skin is black like an oven because of the burning heat of famine. they ravished the women in zion the virgins in the cities of judah. princes were hanged up by their hand the faces of elders were not honored. the young men bare the mill and the children stumbled under the wood. the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their music. the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into mourning. the crown is fallen from our head woe unto us for we have sinned. for this our heart is faint for these things our eyes are dim for the mountain of zion which is desolate the foxes walk upon it. thou o jehovah abidest for ever thy throne is from generation to generation. wherefore dost thou forget us for ever [and] forsake us so long time turn thou us unto thee o jehovah and we shall be turned renew our days as of old. but thou hast utterly rejected us thou art very wroth against us.  now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth [month] in the fifth [day] of the month as i was among the captives by the river chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god. in the fifth [day] of the month which was the fifth year of king jehoiachins captivity the word of jehovah came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of jehovah was there upon him. and i looked and behold a stormy wind came out of the north a great cloud with a fire infolding itself and a brightness round about it and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal out of the midst of the fire. and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man. and every one had four faces and every one of them had four wings. and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like burnished brass. and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]  their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward. as for the likeness of their faces they had the face of a man and they four had the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four had also the face of an eagle. and their faces and their wings were separate above two [wings] of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies. and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went they turned not when they went. as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire like the appearance of torches [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning. and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures for each of the four faces thereof.  the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. when they went they went in their four directions they turned not when they went. as for their rims they were high and dreadful and they four had their rims full of eyes round about. and when the living creatures went the wheels went beside them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up. whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was the spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. and over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament like the terrible crystal to look upon stretched forth over their heads above.  and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies. and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters like the voice of the almighty a noise of tumult like the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings. and there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads when they stood they let down their wings. and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. and i saw as it were glowing metal as the appearance of fire within it round about from the appearance of his loins and upward and from the appearance of his loins and downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and there was brightness round about him.  as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about. this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of jehovah. and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake. and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak with thee. and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet and i heard him that spake unto me. and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to nations that are rebellious which have rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day. and the children are impudent and stiffhearted i do sent thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah. and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.  and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns are with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they are a rebellious house. and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious. but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that which i give thee. and when i looked behold a hand was put forth unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there were written therein lamentations and mourning and woe. and he said unto me son of man eat that which thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel. so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat the roll. and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee. then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.  and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them. for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language but to the house of israel not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language whose words thou canst not understand. surely if i sent thee to them they would hearken unto thee. but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart. behold i have made thy face hard against their faces and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they are a rebellious house. moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart and hear with thine ears. and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord jehovah whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.  then the spirit lifted me up and i heard behind me the voice of a great rushing [saying] blessed be the glory of jehovah from his place. and [i heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another and the noise of the wheels beside them even the noise of a great rushing. so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit and the hand of jehovah was strong upon me. then i came to them of the captivity at tel abib that dwelt by the river chebar and to where they dwelt and i sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me. when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thy hand.  yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul. again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thy hand. nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he took warning and thou hast delivered thy soul. and the hand of jehovah was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee. then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of jehovah stood there as the glory which i saw by the river chebar and i fell on my face. then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and he spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thy house.  but thou son of man behold they shall lay bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house. but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house. thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and portray upon it a city even jerusalem and lay siege against it and build forts against it and cast up a mound against it set camps also against it and plant battering rams against it round about. and take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face toward it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it. this shall be a sign to the house of israel. moreover lie thou upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it [according to] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.  for i have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days even three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel. and again when thou hast accomplished these thou shalt lie on thy right side and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days each day for a year have i appointed it unto thee. and thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem with thine arm uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it. and behold i lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege. take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof [according to] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side even three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. and thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it. and thou shalt drink water by measure the sixth part of a hin from time to time shalt thou drink.  and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man. and jehovah said even thus shall the children of israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither i will drive them. then said i ah lord jehovah behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn of beasts neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. then he said unto me see i have given thee cows dung for mans dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon. moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay  that they may want bread and water and be dismayed one with another and pine away in their iniquity. and thou son of man take thee a sharp sword [as] a barbers razor shalt thou take it unto thee and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair.  a third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite with the sword round about it and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind and i will draw out a sword after them. and thou shalt take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts. and of these again shalt thou take and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel. thus saith the lord jehovah this is jerusalem i have set her in the midst of the nations and countries are round about her. and she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have rejected mine ordinances and as for my statutes they have not walked in them.  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept mine ordinances neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i even i am against thee and i will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations. therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments on thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter unto all the winds. wherefore as i live saith the lord jehovah surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish [thee] neither shall mine eye spare and i also will have no pity.  a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and a third part i will scatter unto all the winds and will draw out a sword after them.  thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my wrath toward them to rest and i shall be comforted and they shall know that i jehovah have spoken in my zeal when i have accomplished my wrath upon them. moreover i will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by. so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath and in wrathful rebukes i jehovah have spoken it when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread and i will send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i jehovah have spoken it. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy unto them  and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah to the mountains and to the hills to the watercourses and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places. and your altars shall become desolate and your sunimages shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols. and i will lay the dead bodies of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars. in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your sunimages may be hewn down and your works may be abolished. and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am jehovah. yet will i leave a remnant in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries.  and those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive how that i have been broken with their lewd heart which hath departed from me and with they eyes which play the harlot after their idols and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. and they shall know that i am jehovah i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them. thus saith the lord jehovah smite with thy hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas because of all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence. he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my wrath upon them. and ye shall know that i am jehovah when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill on all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.  and i will stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate and waste from the wilderness toward diblah throughout all their habitations and they shall know that i am jehovah. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying and thou son of man thus saith the lord jehovah unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land. now is the end upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and i will bring upon thee all thine abominations. and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will bring thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah an evil an only evil behold it cometh. an end is come the end is come it awaketh against thee behold it cometh. thy doom is come unto thee o inhabitant of the land the time is come the day is near [a day of] tumult and not [of] joyful shouting upon the mountains.  now will i shortly pour out my wrath upon thee and accomplish mine anger against thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and i will bring upon thee all thine abominations. and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will bring upon thee according to thy ways and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i jehovah do smite. behold the day behold it cometh thy doom is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded. violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them [shall remain] nor of their multitude nor of their wealth neither shall there be eminency among them. the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they be yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof none shall return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. they have blown the trumpet and have made all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.  the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him. but those of them that escape shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them moaning every one in his iniquity. all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water. they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads. they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be as an unclean thing their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of jehovah they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity. as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things therein therefore have i made it unto them as an unclean thing. and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall profane it.  my face will i turn also from them and they shall profane my secret [place] and robbers shall enter into it and profane it. make the chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. wherefore i will bring the worst of the nations and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pride of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be profaned. destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none. mischief shall come upon mischief and rumor shall be upon rumor and they shall seek a vision of the prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the elders. the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will i judge them and they shall know that i am jehovah. and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth [month] in the fifth [day] of the month as i sat in my house and the elders of judah sat before me that the hand of the lord jehovah fell there upon me.  then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins and downward fire and from his loins and upward as the appearance of brightness as it were glowing metal. and he put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head and the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy. and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the appearance that i saw in the plain. then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. and he said unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel do commit here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.  and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall. then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door. and he said unto me go in and see the wicked abominations that they do here. so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel portrayed upon the wall round about. and there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan every man with his censer in his hand and the odor of the cloud of incense went up. then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the elders of the house of israel do in the dark every man in his chambers of imagery for they say jehovah seeth us not jehovah hath forsaken the land. he said also unto me thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do. then he brought me to the door of the gate of jehovahs house which was toward the north and behold there sat the women weeping for tammuz.  then said he unto me hast thou seen [this] o son of man thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these. and he brought me into the inner court of jehovahs house and behold at the door of the temple of jehovah between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of jehovah and their faces toward the east and they were worshipping the sun toward the east. then he said unto me hast thou seen [this] o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have turned again to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose. therefore will i also deal in wrath mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them. then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.  and behold six men came from the way of the upper gate which lieth toward the north every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen with a writers inkhorn by his side. and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar. and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon it was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed in linen who had the writers inkhorn by his side. and jehovah said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. and to the others he said in my hearing go ye through the city after him and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly the old man the young man and the virgin and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary. then they began at the old men that were before the house. and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth. and they went forth and smote in the city.  and it came to pass while they were smiting and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord jehovah wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of wrestling [of judgment] for they say jehovah hath forsaken the land and jehovah seeth not. and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will bring their way upon their head. and behold the man clothed in linen who had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast commanded me. then i looked and behold in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. and he spake unto the man clothed in linen and said go in between the whirling [wheels] even under the cherub and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city. and he went in in my sight.  now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court. and the glory of jehovah mounted up from the cherub [and stood] over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of jehovahs glory. and the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court as the voice of god almighty when he speaketh. and it came to pass when he commanded the man clothed in linen saying take fire from between the whirling wheels from between the cherubim that he went in and stood beside a wheel. and the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim and took [thereof] and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen who took it and went out. and there appeared in the cherubim the form of a mans hand under their wings. and i looked and behold four wheels beside the cherubim one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.  and as for their appearance they four had one likeness as if a wheel have been within a wheel. when they went they went in their four directions they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went. and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about [even] the wheels that they four had. as for the wheels they were called in my hearing the whirling [wheels]. and every one had four faces the first face was the face of the cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third face the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle. and the cherubim mounted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river chebar. and when the cherubim went the wheels went beside them and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the wheels also turned not from beside them. when they stood these stood and when they mounted up these mounted up with them for the spirit of the living creature was in them.  and the glory of jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim. and the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth and the wheels beside them and they stood at the door of the east gate of jehovahs house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above. this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar and i knew that they were cherubim. every one had four faces and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. and as for the likeness of their faces they were the faces which i saw by the river chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward. moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of jehovahs house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men and i saw in the midst of them jaazaniah the son of azzur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people. and he said unto me son of man these are the men that devise iniquity and that give wicked counsel in this city  that say [the time] is not near to build houses this [city] is the caldron and we are the flesh. therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man. and the spirit of jehovah fell upon me and he said unto me speak thus saith jehovah thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind. ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this [city] is the caldron but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. ye have feared the sword and i will bring the sword upon you saith the lord jehovah. and i will bring you forth out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you. ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am jehovah. this [city] shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof i will judge you in the border of israel  and ye shall know that i am jehovah for ye have not walked in my statutes neither have ye executed mine ordinances but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you. and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died. then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord jehovah wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel all of them [are they] unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from jehovah unto us is this land given for a possession. therefore say thus saith the lord jehovah whereas i have removed them far off among the nations and whereas i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.  therefore say thus saith the lord jehovah i will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel.  and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god. but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will bring their way upon their own heads saith the lord jehovah. then did the cherubim lift up their wings and the wheels were beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above. and the glory of jehovah went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. and the spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity. so the vision that i had seen went up from me.  then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that jehovah had showed me. the word of jehovah also came unto me saying  son of man thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house that have eyes to see and see not that have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house. therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they are a rebellious house. and thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight as when men go forth into exile. dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby. in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder and carry it forth in the dark thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the land for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel. and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for removing and in the even i digged through the wall with my hand i brought it forth in the dark and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.  and in the morning came the word of jehovah unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou  say thou unto them thus saith the lord jehovah this burden [concerneth] the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel among whom they are. say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto them they shall go into exile into captivity. and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face because he shall not see the land with his eyes. my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there. and i will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them. and they shall know that i am jehovah when i shall disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come and they shall know that i am jehovah.  moreover the word of jehovah came to me saying son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord jehovah concerning the inhabitants of jerusalem and the land of israel they shall eat their bread with fearfulness and drink their water in dismay that her land may be desolate [and despoiled] of all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be a desolation and ye shall know that i am jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man what is this proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus saith the lord jehovah i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the fulfilment of every vision. for there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel.  for i am jehovah i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall be performed it shall be no more deferred for in your days o rebellious house will i speak the word and will perform it saith the lord jehovah. again the word of jehovah came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many day to come and he prophesieth of times that are far off. therefore say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah there shall none of my words be deferred any more but the word which i shall speak shall be performed saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart hear ye the word of jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing o israel thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. ye have not gone up into the gaps neither built up the wall for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of jehovah.  they have seen falsehood and lying divination that say jehovah saith but jehovah hath not sent them and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed. have ye not seen a false vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination in that ye say jehovah saith albeit i have not spoken therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because ye have spoken falsehood and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord jehovah. and my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions and that divine lies they shall not be in the council of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord jehovah. because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there is no peace and when one buildeth up a wall behold they daub it with untempered [mortar] say unto them that daub it with untempered [mortar] that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it.  lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it therefore thus saith the lord jehovah i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in wrath to consume it. so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar] and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am jehovah. thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar] and i will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it [to wit] the prophets of israel that prophesy concerning jerusalem and that see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord jehovah. and thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them  and say thus saith the lord jehovah woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows and make kerchiefs for the head of [persons of] every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and save souls alive for yourselves and ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies. wherefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make [them] fly and i will tear them from your arms and i will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly. your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am jehovah. because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way and be saved alive  therefore ye shall no more see false visions nor divine divinations and i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am jehovah. then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man these men have taken their idols into their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be inquired of at all by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah every man of the house of israel that taketh his idols into his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols. therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah return ye and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations.  for every one of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn in israel that separateth himself from me and taketh his idols into his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me i jehovah will answer him by myself and i will set my face against that man and will make him an astonishment for a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am jehovah. and if the prophet be deceived and speak a word i jehovah have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel. and they shall bear their iniquity the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh [unto him] that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying  son of man when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass and i stretch out my hand upon it and break the staff of the bread thereof and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord jehovah. if i cause evil beasts to pass through the land and they ravage it and it be made desolate so that no man may pass through because of the beasts though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord jehovah they should deliver neither sons nor daughters they only should be delivered but the land should be desolate. or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off from it man and beast though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord jehovah they should deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only should be delivered themselves. or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast  though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord jehovah they should deliver neither son nor daughter they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. for thus saith the lord jehovah how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the evil beasts and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it. and they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man what is the vinetree more than any tree the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest shall wood be taken thereof to make any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon  behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire hath devoured both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it profitable for any work behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned shall it yet be meet for any work therefore thus saith the lord jehovah as the vinetree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem. and i will set my face against them they shall go forth from the fire but the fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am jehovah when i set my face against them. and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the lord jehovah. again the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations and say thus saith the lord jehovah unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the canaanite the amorite was thy father and thy mother was a hittite.  and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all. no eye pitied thee to do any of these things unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field for that thy person was abhorred in the day that thou wast born. and when i passed by thee and saw thee weltering in thy blood i said unto thee [though thou art] in thy blood live yea i said unto thee [though thou art] in thy blood live. i caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field and thou didst increase and wax great and thou attainedst to excellent ornament thy breasts were fashioned and thy hair was grown yet thou wast naked and bare. now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord jehovah and thou becamest mine. then washed i thee with water yea i thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil.  i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with sealskin and i girded thee about with fine linen and covered thee with silk. and i decked thee with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck. and i put a ring upon thy nose and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thy head. thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper unto royal estate. and thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty for it was perfect through my majesty which i had put upon thee saith the lord jehovah. but thou didst trust in thy beauty and playedst the harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by his it was. and thou didst take of thy garments and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors and playedst the harlot upon them [the like things] shall not come neither shall it be [so].  thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest for thee images of men and didst play the harlot with them and thou tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them. my bread also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor and [thus] it was saith the lord jehovah. moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. were thy whoredoms a small matter that thou hast slain my children and delivered them up in causing them to pass through [the fire] unto them and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast weltering in thy blood. and it is come to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the lord jehovah that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.  thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way and hast made thy beauty an abomination and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredom. thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbors great of flesh and hast multiplied thy whoredom to provoke me to anger. behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine ordinary [food] and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines that are ashamed of thy lewd way. thou hast played the harlot also with the assyrians because thou wast insatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet thou wast not satisfied. thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. how weak is thy heart saith the lord jehovah seeing thou doest all these things the work of an impudent harlot in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way and makest thy lofty place in every street and hast not been as a harlot in that thou scornest hire.  a wife that committeth adultery that taketh strangers instead of her husband they give gifts to all harlots but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and bribest them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms. and thou art different from [other] women in thy whoredoms in that none followeth thee to play the harlot and whereas thou givest hire and no hire is given unto thee therefore thou art different. wherefore o harlot hear the word of jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and because of all the idols of thy abominations and for the blood of thy children that thou didst give unto them therefore behold i will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather them against thee on every side and will uncover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness. and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and i will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.  i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thy vaulted place and break down thy lofty places and they shall strip thee of thy clothes and take thy fair jewels and they shall leave thee naked and bare. they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords. and they shall burn thy houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou shalt also give no hire any more. so will i cause my wrath toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry. because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast raged against me in all these things therefore behold i also will bring thy way upon thy head saith the lord jehovah and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations. behold every one that useth proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter.  thou art the daughter of thy mother that loatheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters who loathed their husbands and their children your mother was a hittite and your father an amorite.  and thine elder sister is samaria that dwelleth at thy left hand she and her daughters and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is sodom and her daughters. yet hast thou not walked in their ways nor done after their abominations but as [if that were] a very little [thing] thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways. as i live saith the lord jehovah sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters. behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw [good].  neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done. thou also bear thou thine own shame in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous that thou yea be thou also confounded and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  and i will turn again their captivity the captivity of sodom and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto them. and thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride  before thy wickedness was uncovered as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of syria and of all that are round about her the daughters of the philistines that do despite unto thee round about. thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith jehovah. for thus saith the lord jehovah i will also deal with thee as thou hast done who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. then shalt thou remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder [sisters] and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant. and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am jehovah that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i have forgiven thee all that thou hast done saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel  and say thus saith the lord jehovah a great eagle with great wings and long pinions full of feathers which had divers colors came unto lebanon and took the top of the cedar he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof and carried it unto a land of traffic he set it in a city of merchants. he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful soil he placed it beside many waters he set it as a willowtree. and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs. there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the beds of its plantation that he might water it. it was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine.  say thou thus saith the lord jehovah shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it may wither that all its fresh springing leaves may wither and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof. yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the beds where it grew. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean tell them behold the king of babylon came to jerusalem and took the king thereof and the princes thereof and brought them to him to babylon and he took of the seed royal and made a covenant with him he also brought him under an oath and took away the mighty of the land that the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people. shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things shall he break the covenant and yet escape  as i live saith the lord jehovah surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die. neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons. for he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant and behold he had given his hand and yet hath done all these things he shall not escape. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah as i live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken i will even bring it upon his own head. and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. and all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind and ye shall know that i jehovah have spoken it.  thus saith the lord jehovah i will also take of the lofty top of the cedar and will set it i will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and i will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell. and all the trees of the field shall know that i jehovah have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i jehovah have spoken and have done it. the word of jehovah came unto me again saying what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge as i live saith the lord jehovah ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in israel. behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die. but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right  and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbors wife neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity and hath not wronged any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath taken nought by robbery hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment he that hath not given forth upon interest neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true justice between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept mine ordinances to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord jehovah. if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth any one of these things and that doeth not any of those [duties] but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbors wife hath wronged the poor and needy hath taken by robbery hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination  hath given forth upon interest and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him. now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins which he hath done and feareth and doeth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbors wife neither hath wronged any hath not taken aught to pledge neither hath taken by robbery but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor that hath not received interest nor increase hath executed mine ordinances hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live. as for his father because he cruelly oppressed robbed his brother and did that which is not good among his people behold he shall die in his iniquity.  yet say ye wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live. the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die. none of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. have i any pleasure in the death of the wicked saith the lord jehovah and not rather that he should return from his way and live  but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live none of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die. yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal. hear now o house of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth therein in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive. because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die. yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal. o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal  therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord jehovah. return ye and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin. cast away from you all your transgressions wherein ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord jehovah wherefore turn yourselves and live. moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel and say what was thy mother a lioness she couched among lions in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps. and she brought up one of her whelps he became a young lion and he learned to catch the prey he devoured men. the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with hooks unto the land of egypt. now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion. and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and he learned to catch the prey he devoured men.  and he knew their palaces and laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof because of the noise of his roaring. then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and they spread their net over him he was taken in their pit. and they put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of babylon they brought him into strongholds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel. thy mother was like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. and it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches. but it was plucked up in fury it was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up its fruit its strong rods were broken off and withered the fire consumed them. and now it is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty land.  and fire is gone out of the rods of its branches it hath devoured its fruit so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation. and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth [month] the tenth [day] of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to inquire of jehovah and sat before me. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah is it to inquire of me that ye are come as i live saith the lord jehovah i will not be inquired of by you. wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah in the day when i chose israel and sware unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i sware unto them saying i am jehovah your god in that day i sware unto them to bring them forth out of the land of egypt into a land that i had searched out for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands.  and i said unto them cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am jehovah your god. but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt. then i said i would pour out my wrath upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt. but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among which they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt. so i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness. and i gave them my statutes and showed them mine ordinances which if a man do he shall live in them. moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth them.  but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they rejected mine ordinances which if a man keep he shall live in them and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. then i said i would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness to consume them. but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight i brought them out. moreover also i sware unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my statutes and profaned my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols. nevertheless mine eye spared them and i destroyed them not neither did i make a full end of them in the wilderness. and i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their ordinances nor defile yourselves with their idols. i am jehovah your god walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them  and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am jehovah your god. but the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept mine ordinances to do them which if a man do he shall live in them they profaned my sabbaths. then i said i would pour out my wrath upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. nevertheless i withdrew my hand and wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight i brought them forth. moreover i sware unto them in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries because they had not executed mine ordinances but had rejected my statutes and had profaned my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols. moreover also i gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that they might know that i am jehovah.  therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me. for when i had brought them into the land which i sware to give unto them then they saw every high hill and every thick tree and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savor and they poured out there their drink offerings. then i said unto them what meaneth the high place whereunto ye go so the name thereof is called bamah unto this day. wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play ye the harlot after their abominations and when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day and shall i be inquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord jehovah i will not be inquired of by you  and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all in that ye say we will be as the nations as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone. as i live saith the lord jehovah surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out will i be king over you and i will bring you out from the peoples and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out and i will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and there will i enter into judgment with you face to face. like as i entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i enter into judgment with you saith the lord jehovah. and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn but they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am jehovah.  as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah go ye serve every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts and with your idols. for in my holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord jehovah there shall all the house of israel all of them serve me in the land there will i accept them and there will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy things. as a sweet savor will i accept you when i bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. and ye shall know that i am jehovah when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country which i sware to give unto your fathers. and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have polluted yourselves and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.  and ye shall know that i am jehovah when i have dealt with you for my names sake not according to your evil ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord jehovah.  and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the south and drop [thy word] toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south and say to the forest of the south hear the word of jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt thereby. and all flesh shall see that i jehovah have kindled it it shall not be quenched. then said i ah lord jehovah they say of me is he not a speaker of parables and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop [thy word] toward the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of israel  and say to the land of israel thus saith jehovah behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north  and all flesh shall know that i jehovah have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath it shall not return any more. sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes. and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt say because of the tidings for it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and it shall be done saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith jehovah say a sword a sword it is sharpened and also furbished  it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter it is furbished that it may be as lightning shall we then make mirth the rod of my son it contemneth every tree. and it is given to be furbished that it may be handled the sword it is sharpened yea it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer.  cry and wail son of man for it is upon my people it is upon all the princes of israel they are delivered over to the sword with my people smite therefore upon thy thigh. for there is a trial and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more saith the lord jehovah. thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thy hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the deadly wounded it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded which entereth into their chambers. i have set the threatening sword against all their gates that their heart may melt and their stumblings be multiplied ah it is made as lightning it is pointed for slaughter. gather thee together go to the right set thyself in array go to the left whithersoever thy face is set.  i will also smite my hands together and i will cause my wrath to rest i jehovah have spoken it. the word of jehovah came unto me again saying also thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come they twain shall come forth out of one land and mark out a place mark it out at the head of the way to the city. thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to rabbah of the children of ammon and to judah in jerusalem the fortified. for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he shook the arrows to and fro he consulted the teraphim he looked in the liver. in his right hand was the divination [for] jerusalem to set battering rams to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to set battering rams against the gates to cast up mounds to build forts. and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight who have sworn oaths unto them but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance that they may be taken.  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are uncovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand. and thou o deadly wounded wicked one the prince of israel whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end thus saith the lord jehovah remove the mitre and take off the crown this [shall be] no more the same exalt that which is low and abase that which is high. i will overturn overturn overturn it this also shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it [him]. and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord jehovah concerning the children of ammon and concerning their reproach and say thou a sword a sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to cause it to devour that it may be as lightning while they see for thee false visions while they divine lies unto thee to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.  cause it to return into its sheath. in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy birth will i judge thee. and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath and i will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men skilful to destroy. thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i jehovah have spoken it. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying and thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city then cause her to know all her abominations. and thou shalt say thus saith the lord jehovah a city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her that her time may come and that maketh idols against herself to defile her thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the nations and a mocking to all the countries. those that are near and those that are far from thee shall mock thee thou infamous one [and] full of tumult.  behold the princes of israel every one according to his power have been in thee to shed blood. in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow. thou hast despised my holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths. slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness. in thee have they uncovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity. and one hath committed abomination with his neighbors wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughterinlaw and another in thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter. in thee have they taken bribes to shed blood thou hast taken interest and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by oppression and hast forgotten me saith the lord jehovah.  behold therefore i have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. can thy heart endure or can thy hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i jehovah have spoken it and will do it. and i will scatter thee among the nations and disperse thee through the countries and i will consume thy filthiness out of thee. and thou shalt be profaned in thyself in the sight of the nations and thou shalt know that i am jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man the house of israel is become dross unto me all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are the dross of silver. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because ye are all become dross therefore behold i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem. as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my wrath and i will lay you there and melt you.  yea i will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i jehovah have poured out my wrath upon you. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man say unto her thou art a land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation. there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they take treasure and precious things they have made her widows many in the midst thereof. her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things they have made no distinction between the holy and the common neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them. her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood [and] to destroy souls that they may get dishonest gain.  and her prophets have daubed for them with untempered [mortar] seeing false visions and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord jehovah when jehovah hath not spoken. the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery yea they have vexed the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully. and i sought for a man among them that should build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none. therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i brought upon their heads saith the lord jehovah. the word of jehovah came again unto me saying son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother and they played the harlot in egypt they played the harlot in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.  and the names of them were oholah the elder and oholibah her sister and they became mine and they bare sons and daughters. and as for their names samaria is oholah and jerusalem oholibah. and oholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians [her] neighbors who were clothed with blue governors and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horses. and she bestowed her whoredoms upon them the choicest men of assyria all of them and on whomsoever she doted with all their idols she defiled herself. neither hath she left her whoredoms since [the days of] egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they handled the bosom of her virginity and they poured out their whoredom upon her. wherefore i delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted. these uncovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and her they slew with the sword and she became a byword among women for they executed judgments upon her.  and her sister oholibah saw this yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister. she doted upon the assyrians governors and rulers [her] neighbors clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men. and i saw that she was defiled they both took one way. and she increased her whoredoms for she saw men portrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans portrayed with vermilion girded with girdles upon their loins with flowing turbans upon their heads all of them princes to look upon after the likeness of the babylonians in chaldea the land of their nativity. and as soon as she saw them she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea. and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her soul was alienated from them.  so she uncovered her whoredoms and uncovered her nakedness then my soul was alienated from her like as my soul was alienated from her sister. yet she multiplied her whoredoms remembering the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt. and she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses. thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in the handling of thy bosom by the egyptians for the breasts of thy youth. therefore o oholibah thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy soul is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa [and] all the assyrians with them desirable young men governors and rulers all of them princes and men of renown all of them riding upon horses.  and they shall come against thee with weapons chariots and wagons and with a company of peoples they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will commit the judgment unto them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal with thee in fury they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy residue shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. they shall also strip thee of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels. thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom [brought] from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more. for thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated and they shall deal with thee in hatred and shall take away all thy labor and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  these things shall be done unto thee for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations and because thou art polluted with their idols. thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give her cup into thy hand. thus saith the lord jehovah thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup which is deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth much. thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria. thou shalt even drink it and drain it out and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof and shalt tear thy breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord jehovah. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. jehovah said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge oholah and oholibah then declare unto them their abominations.  for they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and they have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass through [the fire] unto them to be devoured. moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths. for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of my house. and furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paint thine eyes and deck thyself with ornaments and sit upon a stately bed with a table prepared before it whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil. and the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness and they put bracelets upon the hands of them [twain] and beautiful crowns upon their heads. then said i of her that was old in adulteries now will they play the harlot with her and she [with them].  and they went in unto her as they go in unto a harlot so went they in unto oholah and unto oholibah the lewd women. and righteous men they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands. for thus saith the lord jehovah i will bring up a company against them and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed. and the company shall stone them with stones and despatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire. thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord jehovah. again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth [day] of the month the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man write thee the name of the day [even] of this selfsame day the king of babylon drew close unto jerusalem this selfsame day.  and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah set on the caldron set it on and also pour water into it gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones. take the choice of the flock and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron] make it boil well yea let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it. wherefore thus saith the lord jehovah woe to the bloody city to the caldron whose rust is therein and whose rust is not gone out of it take out of it piece after piece no lot is fallen upon it. for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the bare rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust. that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the bare rock that it should not be covered. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah woe to the bloody city i also will make the pile great. heap on the wood make the fire hot boil well the flesh and make thick the broth and let the bones be burned.  then set it empty upon the coals thereof that it may be hot and the brass thereof may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the rust of it may be consumed. she hath wearied [herself] with toil yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her her rust [goeth not forth] by fire. in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my wrath toward thee to rest. i jehovah have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord jehovah. also the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down. sigh but not aloud make no mourning for the dead bind thy headtire upon thee and put thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men. so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded.  and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so then i said unto them the word of jehovah came unto me saying speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will profane my sanctuary the pride of your power the desire of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword. and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men. and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away in your iniquities and moan one toward another. thus shall ezekiel be unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do when this cometh then shall ye know that i am the lord jehovah. and thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their heart their sons and their daughters  that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears  in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb so shalt thou be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the children of ammon and prophesy against them and say unto the children of ammon hear the word of the lord jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was made desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity therefore behold i will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession and they shall set their encampments in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk. and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the children of ammon a couchingplace for flocks and ye shall know that i am jehovah.  for thus saith the lord jehovah because thou hast clapped thy hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of israel  therefore behold i have stretched out my hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations and i will cut thee off from the peoples and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the nations therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country beth jeshimoth baal meon and kiriathaim unto the children of the east [to go] against the children of ammon and i will give them for a possession that the children of ammon may not be remembered among the nations. and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah i will stretch out my hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman even unto dedan shall they fall by the sword.  and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will stretch out my hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethites and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. and i will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes and they shall know that i am jehovah when i shall lay my vengeance upon them. and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first [day] of the month that the word of jehovah came unto me saying  son of man because that tyre hath said against jerusalem aha she is broken [that was] the gate of the peoples she is turned unto me i shall be replenished now that she is laid waste  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee o tyre and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth its waves to come up. and they shall destroy the walls of tyre and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her a bare rock. she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord jehovah and she shall become a spoil to the nations. and her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword and they shall know that i am jehovah. for thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will bring upon tyre nebuchadrezzar king of babylon king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and a company and much people.  he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make forts against thee and cast up a mound against thee and raise up the buckler against thee. and he shall set his battering engines against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wagons and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people with the sword and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground. and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters. and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.  and i will make thee a bare rock thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets thou shalt be built no more for i jehovah have spoken it saith the lord jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah to tyre shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded groan when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and strip off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble every moment and be astonished at thee. and they shall take up a lamentation over thee and say to thee how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited by seafaring men the renowned city that was strong in the sea she and her inhabitants that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure. for thus saith the lord jehovah when i shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up the deep upon thee and the great waters shall cover thee  then will i bring thee down with them that descend into the pit to the people of old time and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth in the places that are desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and i will set glory in the land of the living i will make thee a terror and thou shalt no more have any being though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord jehovah. the word of jehovah came again unto me saying and thou son of man take up a lamentation over tyre and say unto tyre o thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles thus saith the lord jehovah thou o tyre hast said i am perfect in beauty. thy borders are in the heart of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beauty. they have made all thy planks of firtrees from senir they have taken a cedar from lebanon to make a mast for thee. of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood from the isles of kittim.  of fine linen with broidered work from egypt was thy sail that it might be to thee for an ensign blue and purple from the isles of elishah was thine awning. the inhabitants of sidon and arvad were thy rowers thy wise men o tyre were in thee they were thy pilots. the old men of gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise. persia and lud and put were in thine army thy men of war they hanged the shield and helmet in thee they set forth thy comeliness. the men of arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about and valorous men were in thy towers they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about they have perfected thy beauty. tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches with silver iron tin and lead they traded for thy wares. javan tubal and meshech they were thy traffickers they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise. they of the house of togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war horses and mules.  the men of dedan were thy traffickers many isles were the mart of thy hand they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony. syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handiworks they traded for thy wares with emeralds purple and broidered work and fine linen and coral and rubies. judah and the land of israel they were thy traffickers they traded for thy merchandise wheat of minnith and pannag and honey and oil and balm. damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches with the wine of helbon and white wool. vedan and javan traded with yarn for thy wares bright iron cassia and calamus were among thy merchandise. dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding. arabia and all the princes of kedar they were the merchants of thy hand in lambs and rams and goats in these were they thy merchants. the traffickers of sheba and raamah they were thy traffickers they traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices and with all precious stones and gold.  haran and canneh and eden the traffickers of sheba asshur [and] chilmad were thy traffickers. these were thy traffickers in choice wares in wrappings of blue and broidered work and in chests of rich apparel bound with cords and made of cedar among thy merchandise. the ships of tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the heart of the seas. thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. thy riches and thy wares thy merchandise thy mariners and thy pilots thy calkers and the dealers in thy merchandise and all thy men of war that are in thee with all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin. at the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake. and all that handled the oar the mariners [and] all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the land and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they shall wallow themselves in the ashes  and they shall make themselves bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning. and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee [saying] who is there like tyre like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea when thy wares went forth out of the seas thou filledst many peoples thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. in the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee. all the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee and their kings are horribly afraid they are troubled in their countenance. the merchants among the peoples hiss at thee thou art become a terror and thou shalt nevermore have any being. the word of jehovah came again unto me saying  son of man say unto the prince of tyre thus saith the lord jehovah because thy heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the midst of the seas yet thou art man and not god though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of god behold thou art wiser than daniel there is no secret that is hidden from thee by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures by thy great wisdom [and] by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the lord jehovah because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of god therefore behold i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness. they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain in the heart of the seas. wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but thou art man and not god in the hand of him that woundeth thee.  thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord jehovah. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation over the king of tyre and say unto him thus saith the lord jehovah thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. thou wast in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardius the topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee in the day that thou wast created they were prepared. thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth and i set thee [so that] thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till unrighteousness was found in thee.  by the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore have i cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i have destroyed thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire. thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i have cast thee to the ground i have laid thee before kings that they may behold thee. by the multitude of thine iniquities in the unrighteousness of thy traffic thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries therefore have i brought forth a fire from the midst of thee it hath devoured thee and i have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. all they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee thou art become a terror and thou shalt nevermore have any being. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward sidon and prophesy against it  and say thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee o sidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i am jehovah when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her. for i will send pestilence into her and blood into her streets and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her with the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that i am jehovah. and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them that did despite unto them and they shall know that i am the lord jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations then shall they dwell in their own land which i gave to my servant jacob. and they shall dwell securely therein yea they shall build houses and plant vineyards and shall dwell securely when i have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them and they shall know that i am jehovah their god.  in the tenth year in the tenth [month] in the twelfth [day] of the month the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt speak and say thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers that hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself. and i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales. and i will cast thee forth into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open field thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens. and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am jehovah because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel.  when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and didst rend all their shoulders and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a stand. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will bring a sword upon thee and will cut off from thee man and beast. and the land of egypt shall be a desolation and a waste and they shall know that i am jehovah. because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it therefore behold i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt an utter waste and desolation from the tower of seveneh even unto the border of ethiopia. no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years. and i will make the land of egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries. for thus saith the lord jehovah at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered  and i will bring back the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their birth and they shall be there a base kingdom. it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations and i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations. and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel bringing iniquity to remembrance when they turn to look after them and they shall know that i am the lord jehovah. and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first [month] in the first [day] of the month the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyre every head was made bald and every shoulder was worn yet had he no wages nor his army from tyre for the service that he had served against it. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall carry off her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army.  i have given him the land of egypt as his recompense for which he served because they wrought for me saith the lord jehovah. in that day will i cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of israel and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am jehovah. the word of jehovah came again unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord jehovah wail ye alas for the day for the day is near even the day of jehovah is near it shall be a day of clouds a time of the nations. and a sword shall come upon egypt and anguish shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down. ethiopia and put and lud and all the mingled people and cub and the children of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword. thus saith jehovah they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord jehovah.  and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. and they shall know at i am jehovah when i have set a fire in egypt and all her helpers are destroyed. in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid and there shall be anguish upon them as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh. thus saith the lord jehovah i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon. he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought in to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain. and i will make the rivers dry and will sell the land into the hand of evil men and i will make the land desolate and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i jehovah have spoken it.  thus saith the lord jehovah i will also destroy the idols and i will cause the images to cease from memphis and there shall be no more a prince from the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt.  and i will make pathros desolate and will set a fire in zoan and will execute judgments upon no. and i will pour my wrath upon sin the stronghold of egypt and i will cut off the multitude of no. and i will set a fire in egypt sin shall be in great anguish and no shall be broken up and memphis [shall have] adversaries in the daytime. the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword and these [cities] shall go into captivity. at tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself when i shall break there the yokes of egypt and the pride of her power shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity. thus will i execute judgments upon egypt and they shall know that i am jehovah. and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first [month] in the seventh [day] of the month that the word of jehovah came unto me saying  son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt and lo it hath not been bound up to apply [healing] medicines to put a bandage to bind it that it be strong to hold the sword.  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong [arm] and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries. and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break the arms of pharaoh and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. and i will hold up the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am jehovah when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt. and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries and they shall know that i am jehovah.  and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third [month] in the first [day] of the month that the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man say unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness  behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a forestlike shade and of high stature and its top was among the thick boughs. the waters nourished it the deep made it to grow the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field. therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field and its boughs were multiplied and its branches became long by reason of many waters when it shot [them] forth. all the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under its shadow dwelt all great nations. thus was it fair in its greatness in the length of its branches for its root was by many waters. the cedars in the garden of god could not hide it the firtrees were not like its boughs and the planetrees were not as its branches nor was any tree in the garden of god like unto it in its beauty. i made it fair by the multitude of its branches so that all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied it.  therefore thus said the lord jehovah because thou art exalted in stature and he hath set his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his height i will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations he shall surely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness. and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left him. upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature neither set their top among the thick boughs nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height [even] all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit.  thus saith the lord jehovah in the day when he went down to sheol i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and i restrained the rivers thereof and the great waters were stayed and i caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for him. i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i cast him down to sheol with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water were comforted in the nether parts of the earth. they also went down into sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword yea they that were his arm [that] dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations. to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword. this is pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord jehovah. and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first [day] of the month that the word of jehovah came unto me saying  son of man take up a lamentation over pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations yet art thou as a monster in the seas and thou didst break forth with thy rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their rivers. thus saith the lord jehovah i will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples and they shall bring thee up in my net. and i will leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee and i will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee. and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height. i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the watercourses shall be full of thee. and when i shall extinguish thee i will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give its light. all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord jehovah.  i will also vex the hearts of many peoples when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not known. yea i will make many peoples amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall. for thus saith the lord jehovah the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee. by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations are they all and they shall bring to nought the pride of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. then will i make their waters clear and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the lord jehovah. when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and waste a land destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am jehovah.  this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith over egypt and over all her multitude shall they lament therewith saith the lord jehovah. it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth [day] of the month that the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit. whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her away and all her multitudes. the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of sheol with them that help him they are gone down they lie still even the uncircumcised slain by the sword. asshur is there and all her company her graves are round about her all of them slain fallen by the sword  whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who caused terror in the land of the living. there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth who caused their terror in the land of the living and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about her all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword for their terror was caused in the land of the living and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit he is put in the midst of them that are slain. there is meshech tubal and all their multitude their graves are round about them all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword for they caused their terror in the land of the living.  and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised that are gone down to sheol with their weapons of war and have laid their swords under their heads and their iniquities are upon their bones for [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. but thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword. there is edom her kings and all her princes who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit. there are the princes of the north all of them and all the sidonians who are gone down with the slain in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord jehovah.  for i have put his terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord jehovah. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land and the people of the land take a man from among them and set him for their watchman if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head. he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him whereas if he had taken warning he would have delivered his soul. but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned and the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchmans hand.  so thou son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me. when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thy hand. nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul. and thou son of man say unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we pine away in them how then can we live say unto them as i live saith the lord jehovah i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel  and thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression and as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. when i say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his righteousness and commit iniquity none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered but in his iniquity that he hath committed therein shall he die. again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right if the wicked restore the pledge give again that which he had taken by robbery walk in the statutes of life committing no iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die. none of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live. yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal.  when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die therein. and when the wicked turneth from his wickedness and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby. yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal. o house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways. and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth [month] in the fifth [day] of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten. now the hand of jehovah had been upon me in the evening before he that was escaped came and he had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man they that inhabit those waste places in the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance. wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes unto your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land  ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbors wife and shall ye possess the land thus shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah as i live surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. and i will make the land a desolation and an astonishment and the pride of her power shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate so that none shall pass through. then shall they know that i am jehovah when i have made the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their abominations which they have committed. and as for thee son of man the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from jehovah.  and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but do them not for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their gain. and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not. and when this cometh to pass behold it cometh then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them even to the shepherds thus saith the lord jehovah woe unto the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the sheep ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill the fatlings but ye feed not the sheep. the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought back that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.  and they were scattered because there was no shepherd and they became food to all the beasts of the field and were scattered. my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth and there was none that did search or seek [after them]. therefore ye shepherds hear the word of jehovah as i live saith the lord jehovah surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my sheep but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my sheep therefore ye shepherds hear the word of jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my sheep at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more and i will deliver my sheep from their mouth that they may not be food for them. for thus saith the lord jehovah behold i myself even i will search for my sheep and will seek them out.  as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad so will i seek out my sheep and i will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. and i will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them into their own land and i will feed them upon the mountains of israel by the watercourses and in all the inhabited places of the country. i will feed them with good pasture and upon the mountains of the height of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie down in a good fold and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel. i myself will be the shepherd of my sheep and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord jehovah. i will seek that which was lost and will bring back that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but the fat and the strong i will destroy i will feed them in justice. and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord jehovah behold i judge between sheep and sheep the rams and the hegoats.  seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture and to have drunk of the clear waters but ye must foul the residue with your feet and as for my sheep they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah unto them behold i even i will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. because ye thrust with side and with shoulder and push all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between sheep and sheep. and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd. and i jehovah will be their god and my servant david prince among them i jehovah have spoken it. and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.  and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing and i will cause the shower to come down in its season there shall be showers of blessing. and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit and the earth shall yield its increase and they shall be secure in their land and they shall know that i am jehovah when i have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them.  and they shall no more be a prey to the nations neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them but they shall dwell securely and none shall make them afraid. and i will raise up unto them a plantation for renown and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land neither bear the shame of the nations any more. and they shall know that i jehovah their god am with them and that they the house of israel are my people saith the lord jehovah. and ye my sheep the sheep of my pasture are men and i am your god saith the lord jehovah. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it  and say unto it thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee o mount seir and i will stretch out my hand against thee and i will make thee a desolation and an astonishment. i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that i am jehovah. because thou hast had a perpetual enmity and hast given over the children of israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity in the time of the iniquity of the end  therefore as i live saith the lord jehovah i will prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee since thou hast not hated blood therefore blood shall pursue thee. thus will i make mount seir an astonishment and a desolation and i will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth. and i will fill its mountains with its slain in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword. i will make thee a perpetual desolation and thy cities shall not be inhabited and ye shall know that i am jehovah. because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas jehovah was there  therefore as i live saith the lord jehovah i will do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known among them when i shall judge thee. and thou shalt know that i jehovah have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to devour. and ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth and have multiplied your words against me i have heard it.  thus saith the lord jehovah when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate. as thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all edom even all of it and they shall know that i am jehovah. and thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah because the enemy hath said against you aha and the ancient high places are ours in possession  therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord jehovah because even because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and the evil report of the people therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord jehovah thus saith the lord jehovah to the mountains and to the hills to the watercourses and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about therefore thus saith the lord jehovah surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the nations and against all edom that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart with despite of soul to cast it out for a prey. therefore prophesy concerning the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the watercourses and to the valleys thus saith the lord jehovah behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath because ye have borne the shame of the nations  therefore thus saith the lord jehovah i have sworn [saying] surely the nations that are round about you they shall bear their shame. but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people israel for they are at hand to come. for behold i am for you and i will turn into you and ye shall be tilled and sown and i will multiply men upon you all the house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places shall be builded and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and be fruitful and i will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate and will do better [unto you] than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am jehovah. yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children. thus saith the lord jehovah because they say unto you thou [land] art a devourer of men and hast been a bereaver of thy nation therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nation any more saith the lord jehovah  neither will i let thee hear any more the shame of the nations neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more saith the lord jehovah. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their way and by their doings their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. wherefore i poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land and because they had defiled it with their idols and i scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them. and when they came unto the nations whither they went they profaned my holy name in that men said of them these are the people of jehovah and are gone forth out of his land. but i had regard for my holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the nations whither they went.  therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah i do not [this] for your sake o house of israel but for my holy name which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye went. and i will sanctify my great name which hath been profaned among the nations which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the nations shall know that i am jehovah saith the lord jehovah when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. for i will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land. and i will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you. a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh. and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep mine ordinances and do them. and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god.  and i will save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the grain and will multiply it and lay no famine upon you. and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. then shall ye remember your evil ways and your doings that were not good and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. nor for your sake do i [this] saith the lord jehovah be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your ways o house of israel. thus saith the lord jehovah in the day that i cleanse you from all your iniquities i will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places shall be builded. and the land that was desolate shall be tilled whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by. and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.  then the nations that are left round about you shall know that i jehovah have builded the ruined places and planted that which was desolate i jehovah have spoken it and i will do it. thus saith the lord jehovah for this moreover will i be inquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock. as the flock for sacrifice as the flock of jerusalem in her appointed feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am jehovah. the hand of jehovah was upon me and he brought me out in the spirit of jehovah and set me down in the midst of the valley and it was full of bones. and he caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry. and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord jehovah thou knowest. again he said unto me prophesy over these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of jehovah. thus saith the lord jehovah unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live.  and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am jehovah. so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold an earthquake and the bones came together bone to its bone. and i beheld and lo there were sinews upon them and flesh came up and skin covered them above but there was no breath in them. then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord jehovah come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live. so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army. then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried up and our hope is lost we are clean cut off.  therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves o my people and i will bring you into the land of israel. and ye shall know that i am jehovah when i have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves o my people. and i will put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i will place you in your own land and ye shall know that i jehovah have spoken it and performed it saith jehovah. the word of jehovah came again unto me saying and thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and [for] all the house of israel his companions and join them for thee one to another into one stick that they may become one in thy hand. and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these  say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his companions and i will put them with it [even] with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in my hand. and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. and say unto them thus saith the lord jehovah behold i will take the children of israel from among the nations whither they are gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but i will save them out of all their dwelling places wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and i will be their god.  and my servant david shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in mine ordinances and observe my statutes and do them. and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant wherein your fathers dwelt and they shall dwell therein they and their children and their childrens children for ever and david my servant shall be their prince for ever. moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. my tabernacle also shall be with them and i will be their god and they shall be my people. and the nations shall know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward gog of the land of magog the prince of rosh meshech and tubal and prophesy against him and say thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee o gog prince of rosh meshech and tubal  and i will turn thee about and put hooks into thy jaws and i will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed in full armor a great company with buckler and shield all of them handling swords persia cush and put with them all of them with shield and helmet gomer and all his hordes the house of togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north and all his hordes even many peoples with thee. be thou prepared yea prepare thyself thou and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto them. after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword that is gathered out of many peoples upon the mountains of israel which have been a continual waste but it is brought forth out of the peoples and they shall dwell securely all of them. and thou shalt ascend thou shalt come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy hordes and many peoples with thee. thus saith the lord jehovah it shall come to pass in that day that things shall come into thy mind and thou shalt devise an evil device  and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell securely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates to take the spoil and to take the prey to turn thy hand against the waste places that are [now] inhabited and against the people that are gathered out of the nations that have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the middle of the earth. sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take the spoil hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take great spoil therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the lord jehovah in that day when my people israel dwelleth securely shalt thou not know it and thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north thou and many peoples with thee all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty army  and thou shalt come up against my people israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring thee against my land that the nations may know me when i shall be sanctified in thee o gog before their eyes. thus saith the lord jehovah art thou he of whom i spake in old time by my servants the prophets of israel that prophesied in those days for [many] years that i would bring thee against them and it shall come to pass in that day when gog shall come against the land of israel saith the lord jehovah that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils. for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel so that the fishes of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground.  and i will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains saith the lord jehovah every mans sword shall be against his brother. and with pestilence and with blood will i enter into judgment with him and i will rain upon him and upon his hordes and upon the many peoples that are with him an overflowing shower and great hailstones fire and brimstone. and i will magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will make myself known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am jehovah. and thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith the lord jehovah behold i am against thee o gog prince of rosh meshech and tubal and i will turn thee about and will lead thee on and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north and i will bring thee upon the mountains of israel and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy hordes and the peoples that are with thee i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.  thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith the lord jehovah. and i will send a fire on magog and on them that dwell securely in the isles and they shall know that i am jehovah. and my holy name will i make known in the midst of my people israel neither will i suffer my holy name to be profaned any more and the nations shall know that i am jehovah the holy one in israel. behold it cometh and it shall be done saith the lord jehovah this is the day whereof i have spoken. and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall make fires of them seven years so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall make fires of the weapons and they shall plunder those that plundered them and rob those that robbed them saith the lord jehovah.  and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place for burial in israel the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea and it shall stop them that pass through and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog. and seven months shall the house of israel be burying them that they may cleanse the land. yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown in the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord jehovah. and they shall set apart men of continual employment that shall pass through the land and with them that pass through those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land to cleanse it after the end of seven months shall they search. and they that pass through the land shall pass through and when any seeth a mans bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamon gog. and hamonah shall also be the name of a city. thus shall they cleanse the land.  and thou son of man thus saith the lord jehovah speak unto the birds of every sort and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of bashan. and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you. and ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord jehovah. and i will set my glory among the nations and all the nations shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon them. so the house of israel shall know that i am jehovah their god from that day and forward.  and the nations shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me and i hid my face from them so i gave them into the hand of their adversaries and they fell all of them by the sword.  according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did i unto them and i hid my face from them. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah now will i bring back the captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and i will be jealous for my holy name. and they shall bear their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they shall dwell securely in their land and none shall make them afraid when i have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of their enemies lands and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. and they shall know that i am jehovah their god in that i caused them to go into captivity among the nations and have gathered them unto their own land and i will leave none of them any more there  neither will i hide my face any more from them for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel saith the lord jehovah. in the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning of the year in the tenth [day] of the month in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten in the selfsame day the hand of jehovah was upon me and he brought me thither.  in the visions of god brought he me into the land of israel and set me down upon a very high mountain whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate. and the man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and hear

and without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court which was at the side of the north gate and their prospect was toward the south one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. and he said unto me this chamber whose prospect is toward the south is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the house  and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the altar these are the sons of zadok who from among the sons of levi come near to jehovah to minister unto him. and he measured the court a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad foursquare and the altar was before the house. then he brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. the length of the porch was twenty cubits and the breadth eleven cubits even by

five cubits on the other side and he measured the length thereof forty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits. then went he inward and measured each post of the entrance two cubits and the entrance six cubits and the breadth of the entrance seven cubits. and he measured the length thereof twenty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits before the temple and he said unto me this is the most holy place. then he measured the wall of the house six cubits and the breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on every side. and the side chambers were in three stories one over another and thirty in order and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the sidechambers round about that they might have hold [therein] and not have hold in the wall of the house.  and the side chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber]. i saw also that the house had a raised basement round about the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. the thickness of the wall which was for the side chambers on the outside was five cubits and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that belonged to the house. and between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. and the doors of the side chambers were toward [the place] that was left one door toward the north and another door toward the south and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. and the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about and the length thereof ninety cubits.  so he measured the house a hundred cubits long and the separate place and the building with the walls thereof a hundred cubits long also the breadth of the face of the house and of the separate place toward the east a hundred cubits. and he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side a hundred cubits and the inner temple and the porches of the court the thresholds and the closed windows and the galleries round about on their three stories over against the threshold ceiled with wood round about and [from] the ground up to the windows now the windows were covered to [the space] above the door even unto the inner house and without and by all the wall round about within and without by measure. and it was made with cherubim and palmtrees and a palmtree was between cherub and cherub and every cherub had two faces so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house round about  from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palmtrees made thus was the wall of the temple. as for the temple the doorposts were squared and as for the face of the sanctuary the appearance [thereof] was as the appearance [of the temple]. the altar was of wood three cubits high and the length thereof two cubits and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the walls thereof were of wood and he said unto me this is the table that is before jehovah. and the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. and the doors had two leaves [apiece] two turning leaves two [leaves] for the one door and two leaves for the other. and there were made on them on the doors of the temple cherubim and palmtrees like as were made upon the walls and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without. and there were closed windows and palmtrees on the one side and on the other side on the sides of the porch thus were the side chambers of the house and the thresholds.  then he brought me forth into the outer court the way toward the north and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place and which was over against the building toward the north. before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door and the breadth was fifty cubits. over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court was gallery against gallery in the third story. and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward a way of one cubit and their doors were toward the north. now the upper chambers were shorter for the galleries took away from these more than from the lower and the middlemost in the building. for they were in three stories and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. and the wall that was without by the side of the chambers toward the outer court before the chambers the length thereof was fifty cubits. for the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits and lo before the temple were a hundred cubits.  and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as one goeth into them from the outer court. in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east before the separate place and before the building there were chambers. and the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north according to their length so was their breadth and all their egresses were both according to their fashions and according to their doors. and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way even the way directly before the wall toward the east as one entereth into them. then said he unto me the north chambers and the south chambers which are before the separate place they are the holy chambers where the priests that are near unto jehovah shall eat the most holy things there shall they lay the most holy things and the mealoffering and the sin offering and the trespassoffering for the place is holy.  when the priests enter in then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister for they are holy and they shall put on other garments and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people. now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east and measured it round about. he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. he measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. he measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. he measured it on the four sides it had a wall round about the length five hundred and the breadth five hundred to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looketh toward the east.  and behold the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like the sound of many waters and the earth shined with his glory. and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar and i fell upon my face. and the glory of jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. and the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of jehovah filled the house. and i heard one speaking unto me out of the house and a man stood by me. and he said unto me son of man [this is] the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever. and the house of israel shall no more defile my holy name neither they nor their kings by their whoredom and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places  in their setting of their threshold by my threshold and their door post beside my doorpost and there was [but] the wall between me and them and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger. now let them put away their whoredom and the dead bodies of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever. thou son of man show the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern. and if they be ashamed of all that they have done make known unto them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the egresses thereof and the entrances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them. this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. behold this is the law of the house.  and these are the measures of the altar by cubits the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth the bottom shall be a cubit and the breadth a cubit and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span and this shall be the base of the altar. and from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits and the breadth a cubit. and the upper altar shall be four cubits and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. and the altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad square in the four sides thereof. and the ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof and the border about it shall be half a cubit and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about and the steps thereof shall look toward the east. and he said unto me son of man thus saith the lord jehovah these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it to offer burntofferings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon.  thou shalt give to the priests the levites that are of the seed of zadok who are near unto me to minister unto me saith the lord jehovah a young bullock for a sin offering. and thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the ledge and upon the border round about thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it. thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin offering and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house without the sanctuary. and on the second day thou shalt offer a he goat without blemish for a sin offering and they shall cleanse the altar as they did cleanse it with the bullock. when thou hast made an end of cleansing it thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish. and thou shalt bring them near before jehovah and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burntoffering unto jehovah. seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sinoffering they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of the flock without blemish.  seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it so shall they consecrate it.  and when they have accomplished the days it shall be that upon the eighth day and forward the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept you saith the lord jehovah. then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut. and jehovah said unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened neither shall any man enter in by it for jehovah the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut. as for the prince he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before jehovah he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate and shall go out by the way of the same. then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house and i looked and behold the glory of jehovah filled the house of jehovah and i fell upon my face.  and jehovah said unto me son of man mark well and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of jehovah and all the laws thereof and mark well the entrance of the house with every egress of the sanctuary. and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of israel thus saith the lord jehovah o ye house of israel let it suffice you of all your abominations  in that ye have brought in foreigners uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to profane it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant [to add] unto all your abominations. and ye have not kept the charge of my holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. thus saith the lord jehovah no foreigner uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any foreigners that are among the children of israel. but the levites that went far from me when israel went astray that went astray from me after their idols they shall bear their iniquity.  yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. because they ministered unto them before their idols and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of israel therefore have i lifted up my hand against them saith the lord jehovah and they shall bear their iniquity.  and they shall not come near unto me to execute the office of priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things unto the things that are most holy but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed. yet will i make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein. but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the lord jehovah  they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge. and it shall be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no wool shall come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court and within. they shall have linen tires upon their heads and shall have linen breeches upon their loins they shall not gird themselves with [anything that causeth] sweat. and when they go forth into the outer court even into the outer court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they minister and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on other garments that they sanctify not the people with their garments. neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to grow long they shall only cut off the hair of their heads. neither shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter into the inner court. neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is put away but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of israel or a widow that is the widow of a priest.  and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. and in a controversy they shall stand to judge according to mine ordinances shall they judge it and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts and they shall hallow my sabbaths. and they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves but for father or for mother or for son or for daughter for brother or for sister that hath had no husband they may defile themselves. and after he is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days. and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sinoffering saith the lord jehovah. and they shall have an inheritance i am their inheritance and ye shall give them no possession in israel i am their possession. they shall eat the mealoffering and the sin offering and the trespassoffering and every devoted thing in israel shall be theirs.  and the first of all the firstfruits of every thing and every oblation of everything of all your oblations shall be for the priest ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your dough to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. the priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself or is torn whether it be bird or beast. moreover when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance ye shall offer an oblation unto jehovah a holy portion of the land the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand [reeds] and the breadth shall be ten thousand it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about. of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in length] by five hundred [in breadth] square round about and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about. and of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand and a breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be the sanctuary which is most holy. it is a holy portion of the land it shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary that come near to minister unto jehovah and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.  and five and twenty thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth shall be unto the levites the ministers of the house for a possession unto themselves [for] twenty chambers. and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad and five and twenty thousand long side by side with the oblation of the holy portion it shall be for the whole house of israel. and [whatsoever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city on the west side westward and on the east side eastward and in length answerable unto one of the portions from the west border unto the east border. in the land it shall be to him for a possession in israel and my princes shall no more oppress my people but they shall give the land to the house of israel according to their tribes. thus saith the lord jehovah let it suffice you o princes of israel remove violence and spoil and execute justice and righteousness take away your exactions from my people saith the lord jehovah. ye shall have just balances and a just ephah and a just bath.  the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer and the ephah the tenth part of a homer the measure thereof shall be after the homer. and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs twenty shekels five and twenty shekels fifteen shekels shall be

israel for a mealoffering and for a burnt offering and for peaceofferings to make atonement for them saith the lord jehovah. all the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in israel.  and it shall be the princes part to give the burnt offerings and the mealofferings and the drink offerings in the feasts and on the new moons and on the sabbaths in all the appointed feasts of the house of israel he shall prepare the sinoffering and the meal offering and the burntoffering and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of israel. thus saith the lord jehovah in the first [month] in the first [day] of the month thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary. and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering and put it upon the door posts of the house and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. and so thou shalt do on the seventh [day] of the month for every one that erreth and for him that is simple so shall ye make atonement for the house. in the first [month] in the fourteenth day of the month ye shall have the passover a feast of seven days

prepare a burntoffering to jehovah seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days and a he goat daily for a sinoffering. and he shall prepare a meal offering an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram and a hin of oil to an ephah. in the seventh [month] in the fifteenth day of the month in the feast shall he do the like the seven days according to the sin offering according to the burntoffering and according to the mealoffering and according to the oil. thus saith the lord jehovah the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days but on the sabbath day it shall be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without and shall stand by the post of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peaceofferings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate then he shall go forth but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. and the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.  and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram and the mealoffering for the lambs as he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah. and on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish and six lambs and a ram they shall be without blemish and he shall prepare a meal offering an ephah for the bullock and an ephah for the ram and for the lambs according as he is able and a hin of oil to an ephah. and when the prince shall enter he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate and he shall go forth by the way thereof. but when the people of the land shall come before jehovah in the appointed feasts he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go forth straight before him.  and the prince when they go in shall go in in the midst of them and when they go forth they shall go forth [together]. and in the feasts and in the solemnities the mealoffering shall be an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram and for the lambs as he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah. and when the prince shall prepare a freewilloffering a burntoffering or peaceofferings as a freewill offering unto jehovah one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east and he shall prepare his burntoffering and his peace offerings as he doth on the sabbath day then he shall go forth and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. and thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burntoffering unto jehovah daily morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. and thou shalt prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning the sixth part of an ephah and the third part of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour a meal offering unto jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance. thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meal offering and the oil morning by morning for a continual burnt offering.  thus saith the lord jehovah if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons it is his inheritance it shall belong to his sons it is their possession by inheritance. but if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants it shall be his to the year of liberty then it shall return to the prince but as for his inheritance it shall be for his sons. moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance to thrust them out of their possession he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. then he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers for the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the hinder part westward. and he said unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sinoffering [and] where they shall bake the meal offering that they bring them not forth into the outer court to sanctify the people. then he brought me forth into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court.  in the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed forty [cubits] long and thirty broad these four in the corners were of one measure. and there was a wall round about in them round about the four and boiling places were made under the walls round about. then said he unto me these are the boiling houses where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. and he brought me back unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house was toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house on the south of the altar. then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate by the way of [the gate] that looketh toward the east and behold there ran out waters on the right side. when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand he measured a thousand cubits and he caused me to pass through the waters waters that were to the ankles.  again he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through the waters waters that were to the knees. again he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through [the waters] waters that were to the loins. afterward he measured a thousand [and it was] a river that i could not pass through for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed through. and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen [this] then he brought me and caused me to return to the bank of the river. now when i had returned behold upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. then said he unto me these waters issue forth toward the eastern region and shall go down into the arabah and they shall go toward the sea into the sea [shall the waters go] which were made to issue forth and the waters shall be healed. and it shall come to pass that every living creature which swarmeth in every place whither the rivers come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish for these waters are come thither and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh.  and it shall come to pass that fishers shall stand by it from engedi even unto eneglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets their fish shall be after their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many. but the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given up to salt. and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow every tree for food whose leaf shall not whither neither shall the fruit thereof fail it shall bring forth new fruit every month because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for food and the leaf thereof for healing. thus saith the lord jehovah this shall be the border whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of israel joseph [shall have two] portions. and ye shall inherit it one as well as another for i sware to give it unto your fathers and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. and this shall be the border of the land on the north side from the great sea by the way of hethlon unto the entrance of zedad  hamath berothah sibraim which is between the border of damascus and the border of hamath hazer hatticon which is by the border of hauran. and the border from the sea shall be hazar enon at the border of damascus and on the north northward is the border of hamath. this is the north side. and the east side between hauran and damascus and gilead

hamath. this is the west side. so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel.  and it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you who shall beget children among you and they shall be unto you as the home born among the children of israel they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of israel. and it shall come to pass that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth there shall ye give him his inheritance saith the lord jehovah. now these are the names of the tribes from the north end

the west side reuben one [portion]. and by the border of reuben from the east side unto the west side judah one [portion]. and by the border of judah from the east side unto the west side shall be the oblation which ye shall offer five and twenty thousand [reeds] in breadth and in length as one of the portions from the east side unto the west side and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. the

sanctuary of jehovah shall be in the midst thereof. [it shall be] for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of zadok that have kept my charge that went not astray when the children of israel went astray as the levites went astray.  and it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land a thing most holy by the border of the levites. and answerable unto the border of the priests the levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth all the length shall be five and twenty thousand and the breadth ten thousand. and they shall sell none of it nor exchange it nor shall the first fruits of the land be alienated for it is holy unto jehovah. and the five thousand that are left in the breadth in front of the five and twenty thousand shall be for common use for the city for dwelling and for suburbs and the city shall be in the midst thereof. and these shall be the measures thereof the north side four thousand and five hundred and the south side four thousand and five hundred and on the east side four thousand and five hundred and the west side four thousand and five hundred.  and the city shall have suburbs toward the north two hundred and fifty and toward the south two hundred and fifty and

day shall be jehovah is there. in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it. and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god and he carried them into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring in [certain] of the children of israel even of the seed royal and of the nobles  youths in whom was no blemish but wellfavored and skilful in all wisdom and endued with knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability to stand in the kings palace and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans. and the king appointed for them a daily portion of the kings dainties and of the wine which he drank and that they should be nourished three years that at the end thereof they should stand before the king. now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah. and the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them unto daniel he gave [the name of] belteshazzar and to hananiah [of] shadrach and to mishael [of] meshach and to azariah [of] abednego. but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kings dainties nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. now god made daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.  and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age so would ye endanger my head with the king. then said daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah prove thy servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink. then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the youths that eat of the kings dainties and as thou seest deal with thy servants. so he hearkened unto them in this matter and proved them ten days. and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the youths that did eat of the kings dainties. so the steward took away their dainties and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse. now as for these four youths god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.  and at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar. and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they before the king. and in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus. and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him. then the king commanded to call the magicians and the enchanters and the sorcerers and the chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. so they came in and stood before the king. and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. then spake the chaldeans to the king in the syrian language o king live for ever tell thy servants the dream and we will show the interpretation.  the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone from me if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill. but if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof. they answered the second time and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show the interpretation. the king answered and said i know of a certainty that ye would gain time because ye see the thing is gone from me. but if ye make not known unto me the dream there is but one law for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the earth that can show the kings matter forasmuch as no king lord or ruler hath asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or chaldean.  and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is no other that can show it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh. for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon. so the decree went forth and the wise men were to be slain and they sought daniel and his companions to be slain. then daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to arioch the captain of the kings guard who was gone forth to slay the wise men of babylon he answered and said to arioch the kings captain wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king then arioch made the thing known to daniel. and daniel went in and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time and he would show the king the interpretation. then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishael and azariah his companions that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon.  then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a vision of the night. then daniel blessed the god of heaven. daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his. and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that have understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him. i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee for thou hast made known unto us the kings matter. therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king and i will show unto the king the interpretation. then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him i have found a man of the children of the captivity of judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.  the king answered and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof daniel answered before the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men enchanters magicians nor soothsayers show unto the king but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and he hath made known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these as for thee o king thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass. but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart. thou o king sawest and behold a great image. this image which was mighty and whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the aspect thereof was terrible.  as for this image its head was of fine gold its breast and its arms of silver its belly and its thighs of brass its legs of iron its feet part of iron and part of clay. thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay and brake them in pieces. then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken in pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away so that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. thou o king art king of kings unto whom the god of heaven hath given the kingdom the power and the strength and the glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand and hath made thee to rule over them all thou art the head of gold. and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth.  and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that crusheth all these shall it break in pieces and crush. and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron it shall be a divided kingdom but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken. and whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron doth not mingle with clay. and in the days of those kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever.  forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure. then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him. the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth your god is the god of gods and the lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret. then the king made daniel great and gave him many great gifts and made him to rule over the whole province of babylon and to be chief governor over all the wise men of babylon. and daniel requested of the king and he appointed shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel was in the gate of the king. nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon.  then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps the deputies and the governors the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. then the satraps the deputies and the governors the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up. then the herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o peoples nations and languages that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of music all the peoples the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and brought accusation against the jews. they answered and said to nebuchadnezzar the king o king live for ever. thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. there are certain jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.  then nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego. then they brought these men before the king. nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them is it of purpose o shadrach meshach and abednego that ye serve not my god nor worship the golden image which i have set up now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the image which i have made [well] but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer thee in this matter. if it be [so] our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand o king. but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.  then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego [therefore] he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. and he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. then these men were bound in their hosen their tunics and their mantles and their [other] garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego. and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste he spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true o king.  he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods. then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace he spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come hither. then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire. and the satraps the deputies and the governors and the kings counsellors being gathered together saw these men that the fire had no power upon their bodies nor was the hair of their head singed neither were their hosen changed nor had the smell of fire passed on them. nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the kings word and have yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god.  therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort. then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon. nebuchadnezzar the king unto all the peoples nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you. it hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the most high god hath wrought toward me. how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation. i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house and flourishing in my palace. i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.  then came in the magicians the enchanters the chaldeans and the soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and i told the dream before him [saying] o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof. thus were the visions of my head upon my bed i saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great. the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was food for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof and all flesh was fed from it.  i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.  he cried aloud and said thus hew down the tree and cut off its branches shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from its branches. nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him. the sentence is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the lowest of men.  this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen and thou o belteshazzar declare the interpretation forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was stricken dumb for a while and his thoughts troubled him. the king answered and said belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation trouble thee. belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.  the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was food for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth.  and whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew down the tree and destroy it nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him this is the interpretation o king and it is the decree of the most high which is come upon my lord the king that thou shalt be driven from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will. and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.  wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar. at the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of babylon. the king spake and said is not this great babylon which i have built for the royal dwelling place by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty while the word was in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven [saying] o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and thou shalt be driven from men and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair was grown like eagles [feathers] and his nails like birds [claws]. and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honored him that liveth for ever for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom from generation to generation. and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou at the same time mine understanding returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom my majesty and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent greatness was added unto me.  now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven for all his works are truth and his ways justice and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand. belshazzar while he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his lords his wives and his concubines might drink therefrom. then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his lords his wives and his concubines drank from them. they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone. in the same hour came forth the fingers of a mans hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the kings palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. then the kings countenance was changed in him and his thoughts troubled him and the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another.  the king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters the chaldeans and the soothsayers. the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and show me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. then came in all the kings wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation. then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were perplexed. [now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house the queen spake and said o king live forever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed. there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him and the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king [i say] thy father made him master of the magicians enchanters chaldeans and soothsayers  forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and showing of dark sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazzar. now let daniel be called and he will show the interpretation. then was daniel brought in before the king. the king spake and said unto daniel art thou that daniel who art of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of judah i have heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee. and now the wise men the enchanters have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not show the interpretation of the thing. but i have heard of thee that thou canst give interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.  then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another nevertheless i will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation. o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty and because of the greatness that he gave him all the peoples nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he raised up and whom he would he put down. but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses he was fed with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until he knew that the most high god ruleth in the kingdom of men and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will. and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thy heart though thou knewest all this  but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine from them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified. then was the part of the hand sent from before him and this writing was inscribed. and this is the writing that was inscribed mene mene tekel upharsin. this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numbered thy kingdom and brought it to an end tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting. peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians. then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with purple and put a chain of gold about his neck and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. in that night belshazzar the chaldean king was slain.  and darius the mede received the kingdom being about threescore and two years old. it pleased darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps who should be throughout the whole kingdom and over them three presidents of whom daniel was one that these satraps might give account unto them and that the king should have no damage. then this daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against daniel as touching the kingdom but they could find no occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him. then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god. then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king and said thus unto him king darius live for ever.  all the presidents of the kingdom the deputies and the satraps the counsellors and the governors have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a strong interdict that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee o king he shall be cast into the den of lions. now o king establish the interdict and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not. wherefore king darius signed the writing and the interdict. and when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house now his windows were open in his chamber toward jerusalem and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did aforetime. then these men assembled together and found daniel making petition and supplication before his god.  then they came near and spake before the king concerning the kings interdict hast thou not signed an interdict that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days save unto thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not. then answered they and said before the king that daniel who is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o king nor the interdict that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day. then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him. then these men assembled together unto the king and said unto the king know o king that it is a law of the medes and persians that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions. [now] the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee.  and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that nothing might be changed concerning daniel. then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep fled from him. then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions. and when he came near unto the den to daniel he cried with a lamentable voice the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever. my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths and they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt. then was the king exceeding glad and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den. so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he had trusted in his god.  and the king commanded and they brought those men that had accused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den. then king darius wrote unto all the peoples nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you. i make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end. he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions. so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign of cyrus the persian. in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.  and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another. the first was like a lion and had eagles wings i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet as a man and a mans heart was given to it. and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it was raised up on one side and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh. after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon its back four wings of a bird the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to it. after this i saw in the nightvisions and behold a fourth beast terrible and powerful and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with its feet and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns.  i considered the horns and behold there came up among them another horn a little one before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things. i beheld till thrones were placed and one that was ancient of days did sit his raiment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was fiery flames [and] the wheels thereof burning fire. a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands of thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened. i beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and its body destroyed and it was given to be burned with fire. and as for the rest of the beasts their dominion was taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.  i saw in the night visions and behold there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man and he came even to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him. and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all the peoples nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. as for me daniel my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me. i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth concerning all this. so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things. these great beasts which are four are four kings that shall arise out of the earth. but the saints of the most high shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever. then i desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast which was diverse from all of them exceeding terrible whose teeth were of iron and its nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with its feet  and concerning the ten horns that were on its head and the other [horn] which came up and before which three fell even that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake great things whose look was more stout than its fellows. i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. thus he said the fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces. and as for the ten horns out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise and another shall arise after them and he shall be diverse from the former and he shall put down three kings. and he shall speak words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and he shall think to change the times and the law and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.  but the judgment shall be set and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  and the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him. here is the end of the matter. as for me daniel my thoughts much troubled me and my countenance was changed in me but i kept the matter in my heart. in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first. and i saw in the vision now it was so that when i saw i was in shushan the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw in the vision and i was by the river ulai. then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last.  i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward and no beasts could stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and magnified himself.  and as i was considering behold a hegoat came from the west over the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. and he came to the ram that had the two horns which i saw standing before the river and ran upon him in the fury of his power. and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with anger against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. and the hegoat magnified himself exceedingly and when he was strong the great horn was broken and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.  and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the glorious [land]. and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them. yea it magnified itself even to the prince of the host and it took away from him the continual [burntoffering] and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.  and the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt offering] through transgression and it cast down truth to the ground and it did [its pleasure] and prospered. then i heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake how long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt offering] and the transgression that maketh desolate to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.  and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision that i sought to understand it and behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man. and i heard a mans voice between [the banks of] the ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision. so he came near where i stood and when he came i was affrighted and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. now as he was speaking with me i fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright. and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. the ram which thou sawest that had the two horns they are the kings of media and persia. and the rough hegoat is the king of greece and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. and as for that which was broken in the place whereof four stood up four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not with his power.  and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up. and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and do [his pleasure] and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. and through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and in [their] security shall he destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand. and the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true but shut thou up the vision for it belongeth to many days [to come]. and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days then i rose up and did the kings business and i wondered at the vision but none understood it. in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes who was made king over the realm of the chaldeans  in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of jehovah came to jeremiah the prophet for the accomplishing of the desolations of jerusalem even seventy years. and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. and i prayed unto jehovah my god and made confession and said oh lord the great and dreadful god who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments we have sinned and have dealt perversely and have done wickedly and have rebelled even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets that spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land.  o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of face as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee. to the lord our god belong mercies and forgiveness for we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of jehovah our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets. yea all israel have transgressed thy law even turning aside that they should not obey thy voice therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of god for we have sinned against him. and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem.  as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon us yet have we not entreated the favor of jehovah our god that we should turn from our iniquities and have discernment in thy truth. therefore hath jehovah watched over the evil and brought it upon us for jehovah our god is righteous in all his works which he doeth and we have not obeyed his voice. and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly. o lord according to all thy righteousness let thine anger and thy wrath i pray thee be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. now therefore o our god hearken unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lords sake.  o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies sake. o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god because thy city and thy people are called by thy name. and while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before jehovah my god for the holy mountain of my god yea while i was speaking in prayer the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation. and he instructed me and talked with me and said o daniel i am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding. at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth and i am come to tell thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore consider the matter and understand the vision.  seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy. know therefore and discern that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the anointed one the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks it shall be built again with street and moat even in troublous times. and after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off and shall have nothing and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and even unto the end shall be war desolations are determined.  and he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and upon the wing of abominations [shall come] one that maketh desolate and even unto the full end and that determined shall [wrath] be poured out upon the desolate. in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true even a great warfare and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision. in those days i daniel was mourning three whole weeks. i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled. and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by the side of the great river which is hiddekel i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with pure gold of uphaz  his body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as flaming torches and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them and they fled to hide themselves. so i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength. yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice of his words then was i fallen into a deep sleep on my face with my face toward the ground. and behold a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. and he said unto me o daniel thou man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent. and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling.  then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand and to humble thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words sake. but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia. now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for the vision is yet for [many] days and when he had spoken unto me according to these words i set my face toward the ground and was dumb. and behold one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i retain no strength. for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither was there breath left in me. then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me.  and he said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong. and when he spake unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me. then said he knowest thou wherefore i am come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i go forth lo the prince of greece shall come. but i will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth and there is none that holdeth with me against these but michael your prince. and as for me in the first year of darius the mede i stood up to confirm and strengthen him. and now will i show thee the truth. behold there shall stand up yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than they all and when he is waxed strong through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of greece. and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will.  and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven but not to his posterity nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others besides these. and the king of the south shall be strong and [one] of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominion. and at the end of years they shall join themselves together and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she shall not retain the strength of her arm neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in those times. but out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place who shall come unto the army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevail. and also their gods with their molten images [and] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold shall he carry captive into egypt and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.  and he shall come into the realm of the king of the south but he shall return into his own land. and his sons shall war and shall assemble a multitude of great forces which shall come on and overflow and pass through and they shall return and war even to his fortress. and the king of the south shall be moved with anger and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he shall set forth a great multitude and the multitude shall be given into his hand. and the multitude shall be lifted up and his heart shall be exalted and he shall cast down tens of thousands but he shall not prevail. and the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former and he shall come on at the end of the times [even of] years with a great army and with much substance. and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision but they shall fall.  so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mound and take a wellfortified city and the forces of the south shall not stand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any strength to stand. but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the glorious land and in his hand shall be destruction. and he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom and with him equitable conditions and he shall perform them and he shall give him the daughter of women to corrupt her but she shall not stand neither be for him. after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take many but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease yea moreover he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him. then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and shall not be found. then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battle.  and in his place shall stand up a contemptible person to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom but he shall come in time of security and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries. and the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant. and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people. in time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them prey and spoil and substance yea he shall devise his devices against the strongholds even for a time. and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army but he shall not stand for they shall devise devices against him. yea they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain.  and as for both these kings their hearts shall be to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. then shall he return into his land with great substance and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant and he shall do [his pleasure] and return to his own land. at the time appointed he shall return and come into the south but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former. for ships of kittim shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and shall return and have indignation against the holy covenant and shall do [his pleasure] he shall even return and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant. and forces shall stand on his part and they shall profane the sanctuary even the fortress and shall take away the continual [burntoffering] and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate. and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries but the people that know their god shall be strong and do [exploits].  and they that are wise among the people shall instruct many yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by spoil [many] days. now when they shall fall they shall be helped with a little help but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries. and some of them that are wise shall fall to refine them and to purify and to make them white even to the time of the end because it is yet for the time appointed. and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that which is determined shall be done. neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all. but in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things.  and he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god whosoever acknowledgeth [him] he will increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for a price. and at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass through. he shall enter also into the glorious land and many [countries] shall be overthrown but these shall be delivered out of his hand edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon.  he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of egypt shall not escape. but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps. but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.  and he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him. and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book. and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt. and they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.  but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased. then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on the brink of the river on this side and the other on the brink of the river on that side. and one said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders  and i heard the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and a half and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished. and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the issue of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but they that are wise shall understand.  and from the time that the continual [burntoffering] shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days. blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and shalt stand in thy lot at the end of the days.  the word of jehovah that came unto hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel. when jehovah spake at the first by hosea jehovah said unto hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom for the land doth commit great whoredom [departing] from jehovah. so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim and she conceived and bare him a son. and jehovah said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause the kingdom of the house of israel to cease. and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel. and she conceived again and bare a daughter. and [jehovah] said unto him call her name lo ruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel that i should in any wise pardon them. but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save them by jehovah their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by horsemen.  now when she had weaned lo ruhamah she conceived and bare a son. and [jehovah] said call his name loammi for ye are not my people and i will not be your [god]. yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people it shall be said unto them [ye are] the sons of the living god. and the children of judah and the children of israel shall be gathered together and they shall appoint themselves one head and shall go up from the land for great shall be the day of jezreel. say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah. contend with your mother contend for she is not my wife neither am i her husband and let her put away her whoredoms from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst. yea upon her children will i have no mercy for they are children of whoredom  for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them hath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my drink. therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and i will build a wall against her that she shall not find her paths. and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now. for she did not know that i gave her the grain and the new wine and the oil and multiplied unto her silver and gold which they used for baal. therefore will i take back my grain in the time thereof and my new wine in the season thereof and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. and now will i uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers and none shall deliver her out of my hand. i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feasts her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn assemblies.  and i will lay waste her vines and her figtrees whereof she hath said these are my hire that my lovers have given me and i will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them. and i will visit upon her the days of the baalim unto which she burned incense when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and went after her lovers and forgat me saith jehovah. therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her. and i will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of achor for a door of hope and she shall make answer there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt. and it shall be at that day saith jehovah that thou shalt call me ishi and shalt call me no more baali. for i will take away the names of the baalim out of her mouth and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.  and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the birds of the heavens and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land and will make them to lie down safely. and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in justice and in lovingkindness and in mercies. i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know jehovah. and it shall come to pass in that day i will answer saith jehovah i will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth and the earth shall answer the grain and the new wine and the oil and they shall answer jezreel. and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them that were not my people thou art my people and they shall say [thou art] my god. and jehovah said unto me go again love a woman beloved of [her] friend and an adulteress even as jehovah loveth the children of israel though they turn unto other gods and love cakes of raisins.  so i bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver and a homer of barley and a halfhomer of barley and i said unto her thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be any mans wife so will i also be toward thee. for the children of israel shall abide many days without king and without prince and without sacrifice and without pillar and without ephod or teraphim afterward shall the children of israel return and seek jehovah their god and david their king and shall come with fear unto jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days. hear the word of jehovah ye children of israel for jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor goodness nor knowledge of god in the land. there is nought but swearing and breaking faith and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood. therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.  yet let no man strive neither let any man reprove for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. and thou shalt stumble in the day and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night and i will destroy thy mother. my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i also will forget thy children. as they were multiplied so they sinned against me i will change their glory into shame. they feed on the sin of my people and set their heart on their iniquity. and it shall be like people like priest and i will punish them for their ways and will requite them their doings. and they shall eat and not have enough they shall play the harlot and shall not increase because they have left off taking heed to jehovah. whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding. my people ask counsel at their stock and their staff declareth unto them for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err and they have played the harlot [departing] from under their god.  they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and terebinths because the shadow thereof is good therefore your daughters play the harlot and your brides commit adultery. i will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot nor your brides when they commit adultery for [the men] themselves go apart with harlots and they sacrifice with the prostitutes and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown. though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear as jehovah liveth. for israel hath behaved himself stubbornly like a stubborn heifer now will jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place. ephraim is joined to idols let him alone. their drink is become sour they play the harlot continually her rulers dearly love shame. the wind hath wrapped her up in its wings and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.  hear this o ye priests and hearken o house of israel and give ear o house of the king for unto you pertaineth the judgment for ye have been a snare at mizpah and a net spread upon tabor. and the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter but i am a rebuker of them all. i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim thou hast played the harlot israel is defiled. their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredom is within them and they know not jehovah. and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore israel and ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity judah also shall stumble with them. they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek jehovah but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from them. they have dealt treacherously against jehovah for they have borne strange children now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah sound an alarm at beth aven behind thee o benjamin.  ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be. the princes of judah are like them that remove the landmark i will pour out my wrath upon them like water. ephraim is oppressed he is crushed in judgment because he was content to walk after [mans] command. therefore am i unto ephraim as a moth and to the house of judah as rottenness. when ephraim saw his sickness and judah [saw] his wound then went ephraim to assyria and sent to king jareb but he is not able to heal you neither will he cure you of your wound. for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will carry off and there shall be none to deliver. i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me earnestly. come and let us return unto jehovah for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up. after two days will he revive us on the third day he will raise us up and we shall live before him.  and let us know let us follow on to know jehovah his going forth is sure as the morning and he will come unto us as the rain as the latter rain that watereth the earth. o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the dew that goeth early away. therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are [as] the light that goeth forth. for i desire goodness and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burntofferings. but they like adam have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me. gilead is a city of them that work iniquity it is stained with blood. and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way toward shechem yea they have committed lewdness. in the house of israel i have seen a horrible thing there whoredom is [found] in ephraim israel is defiled. also o judah there is a harvest appointed for thee when i bring back the captivity of my people.  when i would heal israel then is the iniquity of ephraim uncovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief entereth in and the troop of robbers ravageth without. and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness now have their own doings beset them about they are before my face. they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies. they are all adulterers they are as an oven heated by the baker he ceaseth to stir [the fire] from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened. on the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine he stretched out his hand with scoffers. for they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. they are all hot as an oven and devour their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me. ephraim he mixeth himself among the peoples ephraim is a cake not turned.  strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth [it] not yea gray hairs are here and there upon him and he knoweth [it] not. and the pride of israel doth testify to his face yet they have not returned unto jehovah their god nor sought him for all this. and ephraim is like a silly dove without understanding they call unto egypt they go to assyria. when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring them down as the birds of the heavens i will chastise them as their congregation hath heard. woe unto them for they have wandered from me destruction unto them for they have trespassed against me though i would redeem them yet they have spoken lies against me. and they have not cried unto me with their heart but they howl upon their beds they assemble themselves for grain and new wine they rebel against me. though i have taught and strengthened their arms yet do they devise mischief against me. they return but not to [him that is] on high they are like a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt.  [set] the trumpet to thy mouth. as an eagle [he cometh] against the house of jehovah because they have transgressed my covenant and trespassed against my law. they shall cry unto me my god we israel know thee. israel hath cast off that which is good the enemy shall pursue him. they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them idols that they may be cut off. he hath cast off thy calf o samaria mine anger is kindled against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency for from israel is even this the workman made it and it is no god yea the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces. for they sow the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind he hath no standing grain the blade shall yield no meal if so be it yield strangers shall swallow it up. israel is swallowed up now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth. for they are gone up to assyria [like] a wild ass alone by himself ephraim hath hired lovers.  yea though they hire among the nations now will i gather them and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes. because ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning altars have been unto him for sinning. i wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law but they are counted as a strange thing. as for the sacrifices of mine offerings they sacrifice flesh and eat it but jehovah accepteth them not now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt. for israel hath forgotten his maker and builded palaces and judah hath multiplied fortified cities but i will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour the castles thereof. rejoice not o israel for joy like the peoples for thou hast played the harlot [departing] from thy god thou hast loved hire upon every grain floor. the threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail her. they shall not dwell in jehovahs land but ephraim shall return to egypt and they shall eat unclean food in assyria.  they shall not pour out wine offerings to jehovah neither shall they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their bread shall be for their appetite it shall not come into the house of jehovah. what will ye do in the day of solemn assembly and in the day of the feast of jehovah for lo they are gone away from destruction [yet] egypt shall gather them up memphis shall bury them their pleasant things of silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their tents. the days of visitation are come the days of recompense are come israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the man that hath the spirit is mad for the abundance of thine iniquity and because the enmity is great. ephraim [was] a watchman with my god as for the prophet a fowlers snare is in all his ways [and] enmity in the house of his god. they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins.  i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the figtree at its first season but they came to baalpeor and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing and became abominable like that which they loved. as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird there shall be no birth and none with child and no conception. though they bring up their children yet will i bereave them so that not a man shall be left yea woe also to them when i depart from them ephraim like as i have seen tyre is planted in a pleasant place but ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer. give them o jehovahwhat wilt thou give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them because of the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of my house i will love them no more all their princes are revolters. ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay the beloved fruit of their womb.  my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nations. israel is a luxuriant vine that putteth forth his fruit according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.  their heart is divided now shall they be found guilty he will smite their altars he will destroy their pillars. surely now shall they say we have no king for we fear not jehovah and the king what can he do for us they speak [vain] words swearing falsely in making covenants therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. the inhabitants of samaria shall be in terror for the calves of bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it. it also shall be carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. [as for] samaria her king is cut off as foam upon the water.  the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall be destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall on us. o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there they stood the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in gibeah.  when it is my desire i will chastise them and the peoples shall be gathered against them when they are bound to their two transgressions. and ephraim is a heifer that is taught that loveth to tread out [the grain] but i have passed over upon her fair neck i will set a rider on ephraim judah shall plow jacob shall break his clods. sow to yourselves in righteousness reap according to kindness break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek jehovah till he come and rain righteousness upon you. ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies for thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty men.  therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed as shalman destroyed beth arbel in the day of battle the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness at daybreak shall the king of israel be utterly cut off. when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt.  the more [the prophets] called them the more they went from them they sacrificed unto the baalim and burned incense to graven images. yet i taught ephraim to walk i took them on my arms but they knew not that i healed them. i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws and i laid food before them. they shall not return into the land of egypt but the assyrian shall be their king because they refused to return [to me]. and the sword shall fall upon their cities and shall consume their bars and devour [them] because of their own counsels. and my people are bent on backsliding from me though they call them to [him that is] on high none at all will exalt [him].  how shall i give thee up ephraim [how] shall i cast thee off israel how shall i make thee as admah [how] shall i set thee as zeboiim my heart is turned within me my compassions are kindled together. i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will not return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one in the midst of thee and i will not come in wrath. they shall walk after jehovah who will roar like a lion for he will roar and the children shall come trembling from the west. they shall come trembling as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of the land of assyria and i will make them to dwell in their houses saith jehovah. ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood and the house of israel with deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with the holy one. ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he continually multiplieth lies and desolation and they make a covenant with assyria and oil is carried into egypt. jehovah hath also a controversy with judah and will punish jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he recompense him.  in the womb he took his brother by the heel and in his manhood he had power with god yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him at bethel and there he spake with us even jehovah the god of hosts jehovah is his memorial [name]. therefore turn thou to thy god keep kindness and justice and wait for thy god continually. [he is] a trafficker the balances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppress. and ephraim said surely i am become rich i have found me wealth in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin. but i am jehovah thy god from the land of egypt i will yet again make thee to dwell in tents as in the days of the solemn feast. i have also spoken unto the prophets and i have multiplied visions and by the ministry of the prophets have i used similitudes. is gilead iniquity they are altogether false in gilgal they sacrifice bullocks yea their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. and jacob fled into the field of aram and israel served for a wife and for a wife he kept [sheep].  and by a prophet jehovah brought israel up out of egypt and by a prophet was he preserved. ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly therefore shall his blood be left upon him and his reproach shall his lord return unto him. when ephraim spake there was trembling he exalted himself in israel but when he offended in baal he died. and now they sin more and more and have made them molten images of their silver even idols according to their own understanding all of them the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the dew that passeth early away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor and as the smoke out of the chimney. yet i am jehovah thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt know no god but me and besides me there is no saviour. i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought. according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me. therefore am i unto them as a lion as a leopard will i watch by the way  i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i devour them like a lioness the wild beast shall tear them. it is thy destruction o israel that [thou art] against me against thy help. where now is thy king that he may save thee in all thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me a king and princes i have given thee a king in mine anger and have taken him away in my wrath. the iniquity of ephraim is bound up his sin is laid up in store. the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children. i will ransom them from the power of sheol i will redeem them from death o death where are thy plagues o sheol where is thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. though he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall come the breath of jehovah coming up from the wilderness and his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.  samaria shall bear her guilt for she hath rebelled against her god they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up. o israel return unto jehovah thy god for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. take with you words and return unto jehovah say unto him take away all iniquity and accept that which is good so will we render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips. assyria shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands [ye are] our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him. i will be as the dew unto israel he shall blossom as the lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon. his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as lebanon. they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive [as] the grain and blossom as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the wine of lebanon.  ephraim [shall say] what have i to do any more with idols i have answered and will regard him i am like a green firtree from me is thy fruit found. who is wise that he may understand these things prudent that he may know them for the ways of jehovah are right and the just shall walk in them but transgressors shall fall therein. the word of jehovah that came to joel the son of pethuel. hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land. hath this been in your days or in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and [let] your children [tell] their children and their children another generation. that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the canker worm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. awake ye drunkards and weep and wail all ye drinkers of wine because of the sweet wine for it is cut off from your mouth. for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number his teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the jawteeth of a lioness.  he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white. lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. the mealoffering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of jehovah the priests jehovahs ministers mourn. the field is laid waste the land mourneth for the grain is destroyed the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth. be confounded o ye husbandmen wail o ye vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley for the harvest of the field is perished. the vine is withered and the figtree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the appletree even all the trees of the field are withered for joy is withered away from the sons of men. gird yourselves [with sackcloth] and lament ye priests wail ye ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth ye ministers of my god for the mealoffering and the drinkoffering are withholden from the house of your god.  sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the old men [and] all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of jehovah your god and cry unto jehovah. alas for the day for the day of jehovah is at hand and as destruction from the almighty shall it come. is not the food cut off before our eyes [yea] joy and gladness from the house of our god the seeds rot under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the grain is withered. how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolate. o jehovah to thee do i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. yea the beasts of the field pant unto thee for the water brooks are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of jehovah cometh for it is nigh at hand  a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness as the dawn spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after them even to the years of many generations. a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and none hath escaped them. the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so do they run. like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle array. at their presence the peoples are in anguish all faces are waxed pale. they run like mighty men they climb the wall like men of war and they march every one on his ways and they break not their ranks. neither doth one thrust another they march every one in his path and they burst through the weapons and break not off [their course]. they leap upon the city they run upon the wall they climb up into the houses they enter in at the windows like a thief.  the earth quaketh before them the heavens tremble the sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining. and jehovah uttereth his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for the day of jehovah is great and very terrible and who can abide it yet even now saith jehovah turn ye unto me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto jehovah your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and repenteth him of the evil. who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a mealoffering and a drinkoffering unto jehovah your god blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the assembly assemble the old men gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber and the bride out of her closet.  let the priests the ministers of jehovah weep between the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people o jehovah and give not thy heritage to reproach that the nations should rule over them wherefore should they say among the peoples where is their god then was jehovah jealous for his land and had pity on his people. and jehovah answered and said unto his people behold i will send you grain and new wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and i will no more make you a reproach among the nations but i will remove far off from you the northern [army] and will drive it into a land barren and desolate its forepart into the eastern sea and its hinder part into the western sea and its stench shall come up and its ill savor shall come up because it hath done great things. fear not o land be glad and rejoice for jehovah hath done great things. be not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth its fruit the figtree and the vine do yield their strength.  be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in jehovah your god for he giveth you the former rain in just measure and he causeth to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first [month]. and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great army which i sent among you. and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and shall praise the name of jehovah your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be put to shame. and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am jehovah your god and there is none else and my people shall never be put to shame. and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit.  and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke. the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of jehovah cometh. and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of jehovah shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem there shall be those that escape as jehovah hath said and among the remnant those whom jehovah doth call. for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring back the captivity of judah and jerusalem i will gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and i will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and they have parted my land and have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine that they may drink. yea and what are ye to me o tyre and sidon and all the regions of philistia will ye render me a recompense and if ye recompense me swiftly and speedily will i return your recompense upon your own head.  forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things and have sold the children of judah and the children of jerusalem unto the sons of the grecians that ye may remove them far from their border behold i will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of judah and they shall sell them to the men of sheba to a nation far off for jehovah hath spoken it. proclaim ye this among the nations prepare war stir up the mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up. beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears let the weak say i am strong. haste ye and come all ye nations round about and gather yourselves together thither cause thy mighty ones to come down o jehovah. let the nations bestir themselves and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the nations round about.  put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come tread ye for the winepress is full the vats overflow for their wickedness is great. multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of jehovah is near in the valley of decision. the sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining. and jehovah will roar from zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but jehovah will be a refuge unto his people and a stronghold to the children of israel. so shall ye know that i am jehovah your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the brooks of judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come forth from the house of jehovah and shall water the valley of shittim. egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the violence done to the children of judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land.  but judah shall abide for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation. and i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for jehovah dwelleth in zion. the words of amos who was among the herdsmen of tekoa which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the earthquake. and he said jehovah will roar from zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn and the top of carmel shall wither. thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of damascus yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron but i will send a fire into the house of hazael and it shall devour the palaces of ben hadad. and i will break the bar of damascus and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of aven and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir saith jehovah.  thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of gaza yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole people to deliver them up to edom but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza and it shall devour the palaces thereof. and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon and i will turn my hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish saith the lord jehovah. thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of tyre yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they delivered up the whole people to edom and remembered not the brotherly covenant  but i will send a fire on the wall of tyre and it shall devour the palaces thereof. thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of edom yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever but i will send a fire upon teman and it shall devour the palaces of bozrah.  thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of the children of ammon yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead that they may enlarge their border. but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah and it shall devour the palaces thereof with shouting in the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind and their king shall go into captivity he and his princes together saith jehovah. thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of moab yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime  but i will send a fire upon moab and it shall devour the palaces of kerioth and moab shall die with tumult with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all the princes thereof with him saith jehovah.  thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of judah yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have rejected the law of jehovah and have not kept his statutes and their lies have caused them to err after which their fathers did walk but i will send a fire upon judah and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem. thus saith jehovah for three transgressions of israel yea for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn aside the way of the meek and a man and his father go unto the [same] maiden to profane my holy name and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge and in the house of their god they drink the wine of such as have been fined.  yet destroyed i the amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet i destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.  also i brought you up out of the land of egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to possess the land of the amorite. and i raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men for nazirites. is it not even thus o ye children of israel saith jehovah. but ye gave the nazirites wine to drink and commanded the prophets saying prophesy not. behold i will press [you] in your place as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves. and flight shall perish from the swift and the strong shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver himself neither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver [himself] neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day saith jehovah. hear this word that jehovah hath spoken against you o children of israel against the whole family which i brought up out of the land of egypt saying you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will visit upon you all your iniquities. shall two walk together except they have agreed  will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is [set] for him shall a snare spring up from the ground and have taken nothing at all shall the trumpet be blown in a city and the people not be afraid shall evil befall a city and jehovah hath not done it surely the lord jehovah will do nothing except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets. the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord jehovah hath spoken who can but prophesy publish ye in the palaces at ashdod and in the palaces in the land of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria and behold what great tumults are therein and what oppressions in the midst thereof. for they know not to do right saith jehovah who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. therefore thus saith the lord jehovah an adversary [there shall be] even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces shall be plundered.  thus saith jehovah as the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of israel be rescued that sit in samaria in the corner of a couch and on the silken cushions of a bed. hear ye and testify against the house of jacob saith the lord jehovah the god of hosts. for in the day that i shall visit the transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground. and i will smite the winterhouse with the summer house and the houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end saith jehovah. hear this word ye kine of bashan that are in the mountain of samaria that oppress the poor that crush the needy that say unto their lords bring and let us drink. the lord jehovah hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall come upon you that they shall take you away with hooks and your residue with fishhooks. and ye shall go out at the breaches every one straight before her and ye shall cast [yourselves] into harmon saith jehovah.  come to bethel and transgress to gilgal [and] multiply transgression and bring your sacrifices every morning [and] your tithes every three days and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened and proclaim freewill offerings and publish them for this pleaseth you o ye children of israel saith the lord jehovah. and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto me saith jehovah. and i also have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water and were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith jehovah. i have smitten you with blasting and mildew the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your figtrees and your olivetrees hath the palmer worm devoured yet have ye not returned unto me saith jehovah.  i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt your young men have i slain with the sword and have carried away your horses and i have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith jehovah. i have overthrown [cities] among you as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning yet have ye not returned unto me saith jehovah. therefore thus will i do unto thee o israel [and] because i will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy god o israel. for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earthjehovah the god of hosts is his name. hear ye this word which i take up for a lamentation over you o house of israel. the virgin of israel is fallen she shall no more rise she is cast down upon her land there is none to raise her up.  for thus saith the lord jehovah the city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left to the house of israel. for thus saith jehovah unto the house of israel seek ye me and ye shall live but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal and pass not to beer sheba for gilgal shall surely go into captivity and bethel shall come to nought. seek jehovah and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph and it devour and there be none to quench it in bethel. ye who turn justice to wormwood and cast down righteousness to the earth [seek him] that maketh the pleiades and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth jehovah is his name that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong so that destruction cometh upon the fortress. they hate him that reproveth in the gate and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.  forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor and take exactions from him of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink the wine thereof. for i know how manifold are your transgressions and how mighty are your sinsye that afflict the just that take a bribe and that turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right]. therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time for it is an evil time. seek good and not evil that ye may live and so jehovah the god of hosts will be with you as ye say. hate the evil and love the good and establish justice in the gate it may be that jehovah the god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph. therefore thus saith jehovah the god of hosts the lord wailing shall be in all the broad ways and they shall say in all the streets alas alas and they shall call the husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing. and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through the midst of thee saith jehovah.  woe unto you that desire the day of jehovah wherefore would ye have the day of jehovah it is darkness and not light. as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him. shall not the day of jehovah be darkness and not light even very dark and no brightness in it i hate i despise your feasts and i will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. yea though ye offer me your burntofferings and meal offerings i will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not hear the melody of thy viols. but let justice roll down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream. did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years o house of israel yea ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselves. therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith jehovah whose name is the god of hosts.  woe to them that are at ease in zion and to them that are secure in the mountain of samaria the notable men of the chief of the nations to whom the house of israel come pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go ye to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines are they better than these kingdoms or is their border greater than your border ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence to come near that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol that invent for themselves instruments of music like david that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief oils but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph. therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away. the lord jehovah hath sworn by himself saith jehovah the god of hosts i abhor the excellency of jacob and hate his palaces therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein.  and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house that they shall die. and when a mans uncle shall take him up even he that burneth him to bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house is there yet any with thee and he shall say no then shall he say hold thy peace for we may not make mention of the name of jehovah. for behold jehovah commandeth and the great house shall be smitten with breaches and the little house with clefts. shall horses run upon the rock will one plow [there] with oxen that ye have turned justice into gall and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ye that rejoice in a thing of nought that say have we not taken to us horns by our own strength for behold i will raise up against you a nation o house of israel saith jehovah the god of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entrance of hamath unto the brook of the arabah. thus the lord jehovah showed me and behold he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth and lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowings.  and it came to pass that when they made an end of eating the grass of the land then i said o lord jehovah forgive i beseech thee how shall jacob stand for he is small. jehovah repented concerning this it shall not be saith jehovah. thus the lord jehovah showed me and behold the lord jehovah called to content by fire and it devoured the great deep and would have eaten up the land. then said i o lord jehovah cease i beseech thee how shall jacob stand for he is small. jehovah repented concerning this this also shall not be saith the lord jehovah. thus he showed me and behold the lord stood beside a wall made by a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand. and jehovah said unto me amos what seest thou and i said a plumbline. then said the lord behold i will set a plumb line in the midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword.  then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel the land is not able to bear all his words. for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thou away into the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there but prophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the kings sanctuary and it is a royal house. then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophets son but i was a herdsman and a dresser of sycomoretrees and jehovah took me from following the flock and jehovah said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel. now therefore hear thou the word of jehovah thou sayest prophesy not against israel and drop not [thy word] against the house of isaac therefore thus saith jehovah thy wife shall be a harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean and israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.  thus the lord jehovah showed me and behold a basket of summer fruit. and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summer fruit. then said jehovah unto me the end is come upon my people israel i will not again pass by them any more. and the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day saith the lord jehovah the dead bodies shall be many in every place shall they cast them forth with silence. hear this o ye that would swallow up the needy and cause the poor of the land to fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell grain and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and dealing falsely with balances of deceit that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes and sell the refuse of the wheat jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works. shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein yea it shall rise up wholly like the river and it shall be troubled and sink again like the river of egypt.  and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord jehovah that i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day. and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and i will bring sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning for an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day. behold the days come saith the lord jehovah that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of jehovah. and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of jehovah and shall not find it. in that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst. they that swear by the sin of samaria and say as thy god o dan liveth and as the way of beersheba liveth they shall fall and never rise up again.  i saw the lord standing beside the altar and he said smite the capitals that the thresholds may shake and break them in pieces on the head of all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword there shall not one of them flee away and there shall not one of them escape. though they dig into sheol thence shall my hand take them and though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down. and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and it shall bite them. and though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good. for the lord jehovah of hosts [is] he that toucheth the land and it melteth and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up wholly like the river and shall sink again like the river of egypt  [it is] he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens and hath founded his vault upon the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth jehovah is his name. are ye not as the children of the ethiopians unto me o children of israel saith jehovah. have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir behold the eyes of the lord jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth save that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith jehovah. for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel among all the nations like as [grain] is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth. all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword who say the evil shall not overtake nor meet us. in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up its ruins and i will build it as in the days of old that they may possess the remnant of edom and all the nations that are called by my name saith jehovah that doeth this.  behold the days come saith jehovah that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt. and i will bring back the captivity of my people israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them. and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which i have given them saith jehovah thy god. the vision of obadiah. thus saith the lord jehovah concerning edom we have heard tidings from jehovah and an ambassador is sent among the nations [saying] arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle. behold i have made thee small among the nations thou art greatly despised. the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground though thou mount on high as the eagle and though thy nest be set among the stars i will bring thee down from thence saith jehovah.  if thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut off would they not steal [only] till they had enough if grape gatherers came to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes  how are [the things of] esau searched how are his hidden treasures sought out all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee [they that eat] thy bread lay a snare under thee there is no understanding in him. shall i not in that day saith jehovah destroy the wise men out of edom and understanding out of the mount of esau and thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of esau by slaughter. for the violence done to thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever. in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that strangers carried away his substance and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of them.  but look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster and rejoice not over the children of judah in the day of their destruction neither speak proudly in the day of distress.  enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity neither lay ye [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity. and stand thou not in the crossway to cut off those of his that escape and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress. for the day of jehovah is near upon all the nations as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy dealing shall return upon thine own head. for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain so shall all the nations drink continually yea they shall drink and swallow down and shall be as though they had not been. but in mount zion there shall be those that escape and it shall be holy and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions.  and the house of jacob shall be a fire and the house of joseph a flame and the house of esau for stubble and they shall burn among them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining to the house of esau for jehovah hath spoken it. and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau and they of the lowland the philistines and they shall possess the field of ephraim and the field of samaria and benjamin [shall possess] gilead.  and the captives of this host of the children of israel that are [among] the canaanites [shall possess] even unto zarephath and the captives of jerusalem that are in sepharad shall possess the cities of the south. and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau and the kingdom shall be jehovahs. now the word of jehovah came unto jonah the son of amittai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me.  but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of jehovah and he went down to joppa and found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of jehovah. but jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea and there was a mighty tempest on the sea so that the ship was like to be broken. then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it unto them. but jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep. so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god will think upon us that we perish not. and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. so they cast lots and the lot fell upon jonah. then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest thou what is thy country and of what people art thou  and he said unto them i am a hebrew and i fear jehovah the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land. then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him what is this that thou hast done for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of jehovah because he had told them. then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land but they could not for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. wherefore they cried unto jehovah and said we beseech thee o jehovah we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood for thou o jehovah hast done as it pleased thee. so they took up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from its raging. then the men feared jehovah exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice unto jehovah and made vows.  and jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. then jonah prayed unto jehovah his god out of the fishs belly. and he said i called by reason of mine affliction unto jehovah and he answered me out of the belly of sheol cried i [and] thou heardest my voice. for thou didst cast me into the depth in the heart of the seas and the flood was round about me all thy waves and thy billows passed over me. and i said i am cast out from before thine eyes yet i will look again toward thy holy temple. the waters compassed me about even to the soul the deep was round about me the weeds were wrapped about my head. i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with its bars [closed] upon me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit o jehovah my god. when my soul fainted within me i remembered jehovah and my prayer came in unto thee into thy holy temple. they that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that which i have vowed. salvation is of jehovah.  and jehovah spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land. and the word of jehovah came unto jonah the second time saying arise go unto nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee. so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of jehovah. now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey. and jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown. and the people of nineveh believed god and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them. and the tidings reached the king of nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes. and he made proclamation and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water  but let them be covered with sackcloth both man and beast and let them cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. who knoweth whether god will not turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them and he did it not. but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was angry. and he prayed unto jehovah and said i pray thee o jehovah was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i hasted to flee unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and repentest thee of the evil. therefore now o jehovah take i beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live. and jehovah said doest thou well to be angry then jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shade till he might see what would become of the city.  and jehovah god prepared a gourd and made it to come up over jonah that it might be a shade over his head to deliver him from his evil case. so jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smote the gourd that it withered. and it came to pass when the sun arose that god prepared a sultry east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and requested for himself that he might die and said it is better for me to die than to live. and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said i do well to be angry even unto death. and jehovah said thou hast had regard for the gourd for which thou hast not labored neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not i have regard for nineveh that great city wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle  the word of jehovah that came to micah the morashtite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem. hear ye peoples all of you hearken o earth and all that therein is and let the lord jehovah be witness against you the lord from his holy temple. for behold jehovah cometh forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. and the mountains shall be melted under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire as waters that are poured down a steep place. for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins of the house of israel. what is the transgression of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem therefore i will make samaria as a heap of the field [and] as places for planting vineyards and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley and i will uncover the foundations thereof.  and all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces and all her hires shall be burned with fire and all her idols will i lay desolate for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return. for this will i lament and wail i will go stripped and naked i will make a wailing like the jackals and a lamentation like the ostriches. for her wounds are incurable for it is come even unto judah it reacheth unto the gate of my people even to jerusalem. tell it not in gath weep not at all at bethleaphrah have i rolled myself in the dust. pass away o inhabitant of shaphir in nakedness and shame the inhabitant of zaanan is not come forth the wailing of beth ezel shall take from you the stay thereof. for the inhabitant of maroth waiteth anxiously for good because evil is come down from jehovah unto the gate of jerusalem. bind the chariot to the swift steed o inhabitant of lachish she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of zion for the transgressions of israel were found in thee. therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to moreshethgath the houses of achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of israel.  i will yet bring unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah him that shall possess thee the glory of israel shall come even unto adullam. make thee bald and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight enlarge thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from thee. woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their hand. and they covet fields and seize them and houses and take them away and they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage. therefore thus saith jehovah behold against this family do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye walk haughtily for it is an evil time. in that day shall they take up a parable against you and lament with a doleful lamentation [and] say we are utterly ruined he changeth the portion of my people how doth he remove [it] from me to the rebellious he divideth our fields. therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of jehovah.  prophesy ye not [thus] they prophesy. they shall not prophesy to these reproaches shall not depart. shall it be said o house of jacob is the spirit of jehovah straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly but of late my people is risen up as an enemy ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely [as men] averse from war. the women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses from their young children ye take away my glory for ever. arise ye and depart for this is not your resting place because of uncleanness that destroyeth even with a grievous destruction. if a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie [saying] i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be the prophet of this people. i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i will surely gather the remnant of israel i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah as a flock in the midst of their pasture they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.  the breaker is gone up before them they have broken forth and passed on to the gate and are gone out thereat and their king is passed on before them and jehovah at the head of them. and i said hear i pray you ye heads of jacob and rulers of the house of israel is it not for you to know justice ye who hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones who also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron. then shall they cry unto jehovah but he will not answer them yea he will hide his face from them at that time according as they have wrought evil in their doings. thus saith jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err that bite with their teeth and cry peace and whoso putteth not into their mouths they even prepare war against him therefore it shall be night unto you that ye shall have no vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and the sun shall go down upon the prophets and the day shall be black over them.  and the seers shall be put to shame and the diviners confounded yea they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of god. but as for me i am full of power by the spirit of jehovah and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin. hear this i pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and rulers of the house of israel that abhor justice and pervert all equity. they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity. the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet they lean upon jehovah and say is not jehovah in the midst of us no evil shall come upon us. therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. but in the latter days it shall come to pass that the mountain of jehovahs house shall be established on the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and peoples shall flow unto it.  and many nations shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of jehovah and to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths. for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of jehovah from jerusalem and he will judge between many peoples and will decide concerning strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more. but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his figtree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of jehovah of hosts hath spoken it. for all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of jehovah our god for ever and ever. in that day saith jehovah will i assemble that which is lame and i will gather that which is driven away and that which i have afflicted and i will make that which was lame a remnant and that which was cast far off a strong nation and jehovah will reign over them in mount zion from henceforth even for ever.  and thou o tower of the flock the hill of the daughter of zion unto thee shall it come yea the former dominion shall come the kingdom of the daughter of jerusalem. now why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy counsellor perished that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail be in pain and labor to bring forth o daughter of zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and shalt dwell in the field and shalt come even unto babylon there shalt thou be rescued there will jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. and now many nations are assembled against thee that say let her be defiled and let our eye see [our desire] upon zion. but they know not the thoughts of jehovah neither understand they his counsel for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshingfloor. arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thy horn iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples and i will devote their gain unto jehovah and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth.  now shalt thou gather thyself in troops o daughter of troops he hath laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek. but thou beth lehem ephrathah which art little to be among the thousands of judah out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth are from of old from everlasting. therefore will he give them up until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel. and he shall stand and shall feed [his flock] in the strength of jehovah in the majesty of the name of jehovah his god and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. and this [man] shall be [our] peace. when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men. and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof and he shall deliver us from the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth within our border.  and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from jehovah as showers upon the grass that tarry not for man nor wait for the sons of men. and the remnant of jacob shall be among the nations in the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through treadeth down and teareth in pieces and there is none to deliver. let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries and let all thine enemies be cut off. and it shall come to pass in that day saith jehovah that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and will destroy thy chariots and i will cut off the cities of thy land and will throw down all thy strongholds. and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand and thou shalt have no [more] soothsayers and i will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands and i will pluck up thine asherim out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy cities. and i will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.  hear ye now what jehovah saith arise contend thou before the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice. hear o ye mountains jehovahs controversy and ye enduring foundations of the earth for jehovah hath a controversy with his people and he will contend with israel. o my people what have i done unto thee and wherein have i wearied thee testify against me. for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage and i sent before thee moses aaron and miriam. o my people remember now what balak king of moab devised and what balaam the son of beor answered him [remember] from shittim unto gilgal that ye may know the righteous acts of jehovah. wherewith shall i come before jehovah and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves a year old  will jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my first born for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul  he hath showed thee o man what is good and what doth jehovah require of thee but to do justly and to love kindness and to walk humbly with thy god the voice of jehovah crieth unto the city and [the man of] wisdom will see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it. are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and a scant measure that is abominable shall i be pure with wicked balances and with a bag of deceitful weights for the rich men thereof are full of violence and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. therefore i also have smitten thee with a grievous wound i have made thee desolate because of thy sins. thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt put away but shalt not save and that which thou savest will i give up to the sword.  thou shalt sow but shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives but shalt not anoint thee with oil and the vintage but shalt not drink the wine.  for the statutes of omri are kept and all the works of the house of ahab and ye walk in their counsels that i may make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof a hissing and ye shall bear the reproach of my people. woe is me for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits as the grape gleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desireth the first ripe fig. the godly man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net. their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently the prince asketh and the judge [is ready] for a reward and the great man he uttereth the evil desire of his soul thus they weave it together. the best of them is as a brier the most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen even thy visitation is come now shall be their perplexity. trust ye not in a neighbor put ye not confidence in a friend keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.  for the son dishonoreth the father the daughter riseth up against her mother the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw a mans enemies are the men of his own house. but as for me i will look unto jehovah i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me. rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness jehovah will be a light unto me. i will bear the indignation of jehovah because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light [and] i shall behold his righteousness. then mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her who said unto me where is jehovah thy god mine eyes shall see [my desire] upon her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. a day for building thy walls in that day shall the decree be far removed. in that day shall they come unto thee from assyria and the cities of egypt and from egypt even to the river and from sea to sea and [from] mountain to mountain. yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein for the fruit of their doings.  feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thy heritage which dwell solitarily in the forest in the midst of carmel let them feed in bashan and gilead as in the days of old. as in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of egypt will i show unto them marvellous things. the nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf. they shall lick the dust like a serpent like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places they shall come with fear unto jehovah our god and shall be afraid because of thee. who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in lovingkindness. he will again have compassion upon us he will tread our iniquities under foot and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. thou wilt perform the truth to jacob [and] the lovingkindness to abraham which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. the burden of nineveh. the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite.  jehovah is a jealous god and avengeth jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries and he reserveth [wrath] for his enemies. jehovah is slow to anger and great in power and will by no means clear [the guilty] jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet. he rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the rivers bashan languisheth and carmel and the flower of lebanon languisheth. the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is upheaved at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein. who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are broken asunder by him. jehovah is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that take refuge in him. but with an over running flood he will make a full end of her place and will pursue his enemies into darkness. what do ye devise against jehovah he will make a full end affliction shall not rise up the second time.  for entangled like thorns and drunken as with their drink they are consumed utterly as dry stubble. there is one gone forth out of thee that deviseth evil against jehovah that counselleth wickedness. thus saith jehovah though they be in full strength and likewise many even so shall they be cut down and he shall pass away. though i have afflicted thee i will afflict thee no more. and now will i break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in sunder. and jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will i cut off the graven image and the molten image i will make thy grave for thou art vile. behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace keep thy feasts o judah perform thy vows for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee he is utterly cut off. he that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee keep the fortress watch the way make thy loins strong fortify thy power mightily. for jehovah restoreth the excellency of jacob as the excellency of israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and destroyed their vinebranches.  the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation and the cypress [spears] are brandished. the chariots rage in the streets they rush to and fro in the broad ways the appearance of them is like torches they run like the lightnings. he remembereth his nobles they stumble in their march they make haste to the wall thereof and the mantelet is prepared. the gates of the rivers are opened and the palace is dissolved. and it is decreed she is uncovered she is carried away and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves beating upon their breasts. but nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water yet they flee away. stand stand [they cry] but none looketh back. take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold for there is no end of the store the glory of all goodly furniture. she is empty and void and waste and the heart melteth and the knees smite together and anguish is in all loins and the faces of them all are waxed pale.  where is the den of the lions and the feedingplace of the young lions where the lion [and] the lioness walked the lions whelp and none made them afraid the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his caves with prey and his dens with ravin. behold i am against thee saith jehovah of hosts and i will burn her chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour thy young lions and i will cut off thy prey from the earth and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. woe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and rapine the prey departeth not. the noise of the whip and the noise of the rattling of wheels and prancing horses and bounding chariots the horseman mounting and the flashing sword and the glittering spear and a multitude of slain and a great heap of corpses and there is no end of the bodies they stumble upon their bodies because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavored harlot the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations through her whoredoms and families through her witchcrafts.  behold i am against thee saith jehovah of hosts and i will uncover thy skirts upon thy face and i will show the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame. and i will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile and will set thee as a gazing stock. and it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say nineveh is laid waste who will bemoan her whence shall i seek comforters for thee art thou better than noamon that was situate among the rivers that had the waters round about her whose rampart was the sea [and] her wall was of the sea ethiopia and egypt were her strength and it was infinite put and lubim were thy helpers. yet was she carried away she went into captivity her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets and they cast lots for her honorable men and all her great men were bound in chains. thou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy. all thy fortresses shall be [like] fig trees with the firstripe figs if they be shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.  behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies the fire hath devoured thy bars. draw thee water for the siege strengthen thy fortresses go into the clay and tread the mortar make strong the brickkiln. there shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off it shall devour thee like the canker worm make thyself many as the cankerworm make thyself many as the locust. thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the cankerworm ravageth and fleeth away. thy princes are as the locusts and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers which encamp in the hedges in the cold day but when the sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they are. thy shepherds slumber o king of assyria thy nobles are at rest thy people are scattered upon the mountains and there is none to gather them. there is no assuaging of thy hurt thy wound is grievous all that hear the report of thee clap their hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually  the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see. o jehovah how long shall i cry and thou wilt not hear i cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save. why dost thou show me iniquity and look upon perverseness for destruction and violence are before me and there is strife and contention riseth up. therefore the law is slacked and justice doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore justice goeth forth perverted. behold ye among the nations and look and wonder marvellously for i am working a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told you. for lo i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation that march through the breadth of the earth to possess dwellingplaces that are not theirs. they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves. their horses also are swifter than leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen press proudly on yea their horsemen come from far they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.  they come all of them for violence the set of their faces is forwards and they gather captives as the sand. yea he scoffeth at kings and princes are a derision unto him he derideth every stronghold for he heapeth up dust and taketh it. then shall he sweep by [as] a wind and shall pass over and be guilty [even] he whose might is his god. art not thou from everlasting o jehovah my god my holy one we shall not die. o jehovah thou hast ordained him for judgment and thou o rock hast established him for correction. thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil and that canst not look on perverseness wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he and makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them he taketh up all of them with the angle he catcheth them in his net and gathereth them in his drag therefore he rejoiceth and is glad. therefore he sacrificeth unto his net and burneth incense unto his drag because by them his portion is fat and his food plenteous.  shall he therefore empty his net and spare not to slay the nations continually i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will look forth to see what he will speak with me and what i shall answer concerning my complaint. and jehovah answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tablets that he may run that readeth it. for the vision is yet for the appointed time and it hasteth toward the end and shall not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not delay. behold his soul is puffed up it is not upright in him but the righteous shall live by his faith. yea moreover wine is treacherous a haughty man that keepeth not at home who enlargeth his desire as sheol and he is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and heapeth unto him all peoples. shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say woe to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and that ladeth himself with pledges  shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booty unto them because thou hast plundered many nations all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee because of mens blood and for the violence done to the land to the city and to all that dwell therein. woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house that he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the hand of evil thou hast devised shame to thy house by cutting off many peoples and hast sinned against thy soul. for the stone shall cry out of the wall and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and establisheth a city by iniquity behold is it not of jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire and the nations weary themselves for vanity for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of jehovah as the waters cover the sea. woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink [to thee] that addest thy venom and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakedness  thou art filled with shame and not glory drink thou also and be as one uncircumcised the cup of jehovahs right hand shall come round unto thee and foul shame shall be upon thy glory. for the violence done to lebanon shall cover thee and the destruction of the beasts which made them afraid because of mens blood and for the violence done to the land to the city and to all that dwell therein. what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it the molten image even the teacher of lies that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein to make dumb idols woe unto him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise shall this teach behold it is overlaid with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. but jehovah is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him. a prayer of habakkuk the prophet set to shigionoth. o jehovah i have heard the report of thee and am afraid o jehovah revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make it known in wrath remember mercy.  god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran. selah. his glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. and [his] brightness was as the light he had rays [coming forth] from his hand and there was the hiding of his power. before him went the pestilence and fiery bolts went forth at his feet. he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations and the eternal mountains were scattered the everlasting hills did bow his goings were [as] of old. i saw the tents of cushan in affliction the curtains of the land of midian did tremble. was jehovah displeased with the rivers was thine anger against the rivers or thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thy horses upon thy chariots of salvation thy bow was made quite bare the oaths to the tribes were a [sure] word. selah. thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. the mountains saw thee and were afraid the tempest of waters passed by the deep uttered its voice and lifted up its hands on high.  the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows as they went at the shining of thy glittering spear. thou didst march though the land in indignation thou didst thresh the nations in anger. thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people for the salvation of thine anointed thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. selah. thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors they came as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. thou didst tread the sea with thy horses the heap of mighty waters. i heard and my body trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entereth into my bones and i tremble in my place because i must wait quietly for the day of trouble for the coming up of the people that invadeth us. for though the figtree shall not flourish neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no food the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls yet i will rejoice in jehovah i will joy in the god of my salvation.  jehovah the lord is my strength and he maketh my feet like hinds [feet] and will make me to walk upon my high places. the word of jehovah which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hezekiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah. i will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground saith jehovah. i will consume man and beast i will consume the birds of the heavens and the fishes of the sea and the stumblingblocks with the wicked and i will cut off man from off the face of the ground saith jehovah. and i will stretch out my hand upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place [and] the name of the chemarim with the priests and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship that swear to jehovah and swear by malcam and them that are turned back from following jehovah and those that have not sought jehovah nor inquired after him.  hold thy peace at the presence of the lord jehovah for the day of jehovah is at hand for jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice he hath consecrated his guests. and it shall come to pass in the day of jehovahs sacrifice that i will punish the princes and the kings sons and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel. and in that day i will punish all those that leap over the threshold that fill their masters house with violence and deceit. and in that day saith jehovah there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and a wailing from the second quarter and a great crashing from the hills. wail ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the people of canaan are undone all they that were laden with silver are cut off. and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search jerusalem with lamps and i will punish the men that are settled on their lees that say in their heart jehovah will not do good neither will he do evil. and their wealth shall become a spoil and their houses a desolation yea they shall build houses but shall not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but shall not drink the wine thereof.  the great day of jehovah is near it is near and hasteth greatly [even] the voice of the day of jehovah the mighty man crieth there bitterly. that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and against the high battlements. and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against jehovah and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as dung. neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of jehovahs wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he will make an end yea a terrible end of all them that dwell in the land. gather yourselves together yea gather together o nation that hath no shame before the decree bring forth [before] the day pass as the chaff before the fierce anger of jehovah come upon you before the day of jehovahs anger come upon you.  seek ye jehovah all ye meek of the earth that have kept his ordinances seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye will be hid in the day of jehovahs anger.  for gaza shall be forsaken and ashkelon a desolation they shall drive out ashdod at noonday and ekron shall be rooted up. woe unto the inhabitants of the seacoast the nation of the cherethites the word of jehovah is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitant. and the sea coast shall be pastures with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah they shall feed [their flocks] thereupon in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening for jehovah their god will visit them and bring back their captivity. i have heard the reproach of moab and the revilings of the children of ammon wherewith they have reproached my people and magnified themselves against their border.  therefore as i live saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah a possession of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall make a prey of them and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.  this shall they have for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of jehovah of hosts. jehovah will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the nations. ye ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my sword. and he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy assyria and will make nineveh a desolation and dry like the wilderness. and herds shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof [their] voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he hath laid bare the cedarwork.  this is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart i am and there is none besides me how is she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand. woe to her that is rebellious and polluted to the oppressing city she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in jehovah she drew not near to her god. her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they leave nothing till the morrow. her prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have profaned the sanctuary they have done violence to the law. jehovah in the midst of her is righteous he will not do iniquity every morning doth he bring his justice to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shame. i have cut off nations their battlements are desolate i have made their streets waste so that none passeth by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man so that there is no inhabitant.  i said only fear thou me receive correction so her dwelling shall not be cut off [according to] all that i have appointed concerning her but they rose early and corrupted all their doings. therefore wait ye for me saith jehovah until the day that i rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. for then will i turn to the peoples of a pure language that they may all call upon the name of jehovah to serve him with one consent. from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering. in that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain. but i will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people and they shall take refuge in the name of jehovah.  the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid. sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem. jehovah hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of israel even jehovah is in the midst of thee thou shalt not fear evil any more. in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not o zion let not thy hands be slack. jehovah thy god is in the midst of thee a mighty one who will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing. i will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly who were of thee [to whom] the burden upon her was a reproach. behold at that time i will deal with all them that afflict thee and i will save that which is lame and gather that which was driven away and i will make them a praise and a name whose shame hath been in all the earth.  at that time will i bring you in and at that time will i gather you for i will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when i bring back your captivity before your eyes saith jehovah. in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest saying thus speaketh jehovah of hosts saying this people say it is not the time [for us] to come the time for jehovahs house to be built. then came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet saying is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses while this house lieth waste now therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts consider your ways. ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages [to put it] into a bag with holes. thus saith jehovah of hosts consider your ways.  go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith jehovah. ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home i did blow upon it. why saith jehovah of hosts. because of my house that lieth waste while ye run every man to his own house. therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew and the earth withholdeth its fruit. and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the grain and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labor of the hands. then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of jehovah their god and the words of haggai the prophet as jehovah their god had sent him and the people did fear before jehovah. then spake haggai jehovahs messenger in jehovahs message unto the people saying i am with you saith jehovah.  and jehovah stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did work on the house of jehovah of hosts their god in the four and twentieth day of the month in the sixth [month] in the second year of darius the king. in the seventh [month] in the one and twentieth [day] of the month came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet saying speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and to the remnant of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes as nothing yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith jehovah and be strong o joshua son of jehozadak the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith jehovah and work for i am with you saith jehovah of hosts [according to] the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt and my spirit abode among you fear ye not.  for thus saith jehovah of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the precious things of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith jehovah of hosts. the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith jehovah of hosts. the latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former saith jehovah of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith jehovah of hosts. in the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month] in the second year of darius came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet saying thus saith jehovah of hosts ask now the priests concerning the law saying if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or any food shall it become holy and the priests answered and said no. then said haggai if one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these shall it be unclean and the priests answered and said it shall be unclean.  then answered haggai and said so is this people and so is this nation before me saith jehovah and so is every work of their hands and that which they offer there is unclean. and now i pray you consider from this day and backward before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of jehovah. through all that time when one came to a heap of twenty [measures] there were but ten when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty [vessels] there were but twenty. i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands yet ye [turned] not to me saith jehovah. consider i pray you from this day and backward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month] since the day that the foundation of jehovahs temple was laid consider it. is the seed yet in the barn yea the vine and the figtree and the pomegranate and the olivetree have not brought forth from this day will i bless [you]. and the word of jehovah came the second time unto haggai in the four and twentieth [day] of the month saying speak to zerubbabel governor of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth  and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations and i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother. in that day saith jehovah of hosts will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel saith jehovah and will make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith jehovah of hosts. in the eighth month in the second year of darius came the word of jehovah unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers. therefore say thou unto them thus saith jehovah of hosts return unto me saith jehovah of hosts and i will return unto you saith jehovah of hosts. be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets cried saying thus saith jehovah of hosts return ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith jehovah. your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for ever  but my words and my statutes which i commanded my servants the prophets did they not overtake your fathers and they turned and said like as jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us. upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is the month shebat in the second year of darius came the word of jehovah unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying i saw in the night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he stood among the myrtletrees that were in the bottom and behind him there were horses red sorrel and white. then said i o my lord what are these and the angel that talked with me said unto me i will show thee what these are. and the man that stood among the myrtletrees answered and said these are they whom jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. and they answered the angel of jehovah that stood among the myrtletrees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest.  then the angel of jehovah answered and said o jehovah of hosts how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years and jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words [even] comfortable words. so the angel that talked with me said unto me cry thou saying thus saith jehovah of hosts i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy. and i am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease for i was but a little displeased and they helped forward the affliction. therefore thus saith jehovah i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith jehovah of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth over jerusalem. cry yet again saying thus saith jehovah of hosts my cities shall yet overflow with prosperity and jehovah shall yet comfort zion and shall yet choose jerusalem. and i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns. and i said unto the angel that talked with me what are these and he answered me these are the horns which have scattered judah israel and jerusalem.  and jehovah showed me four smiths. then said i what come these to do and he spake saying these are the horns which scattered judah so that no man did lift up his head but these are come to terrify them to cast down the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of judah to scatter it. and i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. then said i whither goest thou and he said unto me to measure jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof. and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him and said unto him run speak to this young man saying jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. for i saith jehovah will be unto her a wall of fire round about and i will be the glory in the midst of her. ho ho flee from the land of the north saith jehovah for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens saith jehovah. ho zion escape thou that dwellest with the daughter of babylon.  for thus saith jehovah of hosts after glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. for behold i will shake my hand over them and they shall be a spoil to those that served them and ye shall know that jehovah of hosts hath sent me. sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith jehovah. and many nations shall join themselves to jehovah in that day and shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee. and jehovah shall inherit judah as his portion in the holy land and shall yet choose jerusalem. be silent all flesh before jehovah for he is waked up out of his holy habitation. and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of jehovah and satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. and jehovah said unto satan jehovah rebuke thee o satan yea jehovah that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire  now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the angel. and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take the filthy garments from off him. and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with rich apparel. and i said let them set a clean mitre upon his head. so they set a clean mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of jehovah was standing by. and the angel of jehovah protested unto joshua saying thus saith jehovah of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou also shalt judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee a place of access among these that stand by. hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men that are a sign for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch. for behold the stone that i have set before joshua upon one stone are seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith jehovah of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.  in that day saith jehovah of hosts shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the figtree. and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. and he said unto me what seest thou and i said i have seen and behold a candlestick all of gold with its bowl upon the top of it and its seven lamps thereon there are seven pipes to each of the lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof. and i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these are and i said no my lord. then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of jehovah unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith jehovah of hosts. who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of grace grace unto it. moreover the word of jehovah came unto me saying  the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. for who hath despised the day of small things for these seven shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel [these are] the eyes of jehovah which run to and fro through the whole earth. then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof and i answered the second time and said unto him what are these two olive branches which are beside the two golden spouts that empty the golden [oil] out of themselves and he answered me and said knowest thou not what these are and i said no my lord. then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth. then again i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold a flying roll. and he said unto me what seest thou and i answered i see a flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubits.  then said he unto me this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it. i will cause it to go forth saith jehovah of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.  then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth. and i said what is it and he said this is the ephah that goeth forth. he said moreover this is their appearance in all the land and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah. and he said this is wickedness and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. then lifted i up mine eyes and saw and behold there came forth two women and the wind was in their wings now they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.  then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these bear the ephah and he said unto me to build her a house in the land of shinar and when it is prepared she shall be set there in her own place. and again i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass. in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses  and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses. then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me what are these my lord and the angel answered and said unto me these are the four winds of heaven which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth. [the chariot] wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country and the white went forth after them and the grizzled went forth toward the south country. and the strong went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth and he said get you hence walk to and fro through the earth. so they walked to and fro through the earth.  then cried he to me and spake unto me saying behold they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. and the word of jehovah came unto me saying take of them of the captivity even of heldai of tobijah and of jedaiah and come thou the same day and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah whither they are come from babylon yea take [of them] silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest  and speak unto him saying thus speaketh jehovah of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of jehovah even he shall build the temple of jehovah and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah and to jedaiah and to hen the son of zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of jehovah.  and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of jehovah and ye shall know that jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. and [this] shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of jehovah your god. and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the word of jehovah came unto zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month even in chislev. now [they of] bethel had sent sharezer and regemmelech and their men to entreat the favor of jehovah [and] to speak unto the priests of the house of jehovah of hosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth month separating myself as i have done these so many years then came the word of jehovah of hosts unto me saying speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month] even these seventy years did ye at all fast unto me even to me and when ye eat and when ye drink do not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves  [should ye] not [hear] the words which jehovah cried by the former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and the cities thereof round about her and the south and the lowland were inhabited and the word of jehovah came unto zechariah saying thus hath jehovah of hosts spoken saying execute true judgment and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the sojourner nor the poor and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart. but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear. yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which jehovah of hosts had sent by his spirit by the former prophets therefore there came great wrath from jehovah of hosts. and it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they shall cry and i will not hear said jehovah of hosts  but i will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. thus the land was desolate after them so that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant land desolate. and the word of jehovah of hosts came [to me] saying thus saith jehovah of hosts i am jealous for zion with great jealousy and i am jealous for her with great wrath. thus saith jehovah i am returned unto zion and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem and jerusalem shall be called the city of truth and the mountain of jehovah of hosts the holy mountain. thus saith jehovah of hosts there shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of jerusalem every man with his staff in his hand for very age. and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. thus saith jehovah of hosts if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days should it also be marvellous in mine eyes saith jehovah of hosts. thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i will save my people from the east country and from the west country  and i will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem and they shall be my people and i will be their god in truth and in righteousness. thus saith jehovah of hosts let your hands be strong ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of jehovah of hosts was laid even the temple that it might be built. for before those days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the adversary for i set all men every one against his neighbor. but now i will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days saith jehovah of hosts. for [there shall be] the seed of peace the vine shall give its fruit and the ground shall give its increase and the heavens shall give their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the nations o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you and ye shall be a blessing. fear not [but] let your hands be strong.  for thus saith jehovah of hosts as i thought to do evil unto you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith jehovah of hosts and i repented not so again have i thought in these days to do good unto jerusalem and to the house of judah fear ye not. these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor and love no false oath for all these are things that i hate saith jehovah. and the word of jehovah of hosts came unto me saying thus saith jehovah of hosts the fast of the fourth [month] and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts therefore love truth and peace. thus saith jehovah of hosts [it shall] yet [come to pass] that there shall come peoples and the inhabitants of many cities and the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another saying let us go speedily to entreat the favor of jehovah and to seek jehovah of hosts i will go also.  yea many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek jehovah of hosts in jerusalem and to entreat the favor of jehovah. thus saith jehovah of hosts in those days [it shall come to pass] that ten men shall take hold out of all the languages of the nations they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you. the burden of the word of jehovah upon the land of hadrach and damascus [shall be] its resting place for the eye of man and of all the tribes of israel is toward jehovah and hamath also which bordereth thereon tyre and sidon because they are very wise. and tyre did build herself a stronghold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets. behold the lord will dispossess her and he will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire. ashkelon shall see it and fear gaza also and shall be sore pained and ekron for her expectation shall be put to shame and the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited.  and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride of the philistines. and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth and he also shall be a remnant for our god and he shall be as a chieftain in judah and ekron as a jebusite. and i will encamp about my house against the army that none pass through or return and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with mine eyes. rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass even upon a colt the foal of an ass. and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the nations and his dominion shall be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. as for thee also because of the blood of thy covenant i have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water. turn you to the stronghold ye prisoners of hope even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee.  for i have bent judah for me i have filled the bow with ephraim and i will stir up thy sons o zion against thy sons o greece and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. and jehovah shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the lord jehovah will blow the trumpet and will go with whirlwinds of the south. jehovah of hosts will defend them and they shall devour and shall tread down the slingstones and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine and they shall be filled like bowls like the corners of the altar. and jehovah their god will save them in that day as the flock of his people for [they shall be as] the stones of a crown lifted on high over his land. for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty grain shall make the young men flourish and new wine the virgins. ask ye of jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain [even of] jehovah that maketh lightnings and he will give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field.  for the teraphim have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and they have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they go their way like sheep they are afflicted because there is no shepherd. mine anger is kindled against the shepherds and i will punish the hegoats for jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle. from him shall come forth the cornerstone from him the nail from him the battle bow from him every ruler together. and they shall be as mighty men treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because jehovah is with them and the riders on horses shall be confounded. and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them back for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off for i am jehovah their god and i will hear them. and [they of] ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and rejoice their heart shall be glad in jehovah.  i will hiss for them and gather them for i have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increased. and i will sow them among the peoples and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and shall return. i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and gather them out of assyria and i will bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon and [place] shall not be found for them. and he will pass through the sea of affliction and will smite the waves in the sea and all the depths of the nile shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of egypt shall depart. and i will strengthen them in jehovah and they shall walk up and down in his name saith jehovah. open thy doors o lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedars. wail o firtree for the cedar is fallen because the goodly ones are destroyed wail o ye oaks of bashan for the strong forest is come down. a voice of the wailing of the shepherds for their glory is destroyed a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of the jordan is laid waste.  thus said jehovah my god feed the flock of slaughter whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be jehovah for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not. for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith jehovah but lo i will deliver the men every one into his neighbors hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land and out of their hand i will not deliver them. so i fed the flock of slaughter verily the poor of the flock. and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the other i called bands and i fed the flock. and i cut off the three shepherds in one month for my soul was weary of them and their soul also loathed me. then said i i will not feed you that which dieth let it die and that which is to be cut off let it be cut off and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another. and i took my staff beauty and cut it asunder that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the peoples. and it was broken in that day and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of jehovah.  and i said unto them if ye think good give me my hire and if not forbear. so they weighed for my hire thirty [pieces] of silver. and jehovah said unto me cast it unto the potter the goodly price that i was prized at by them. and i took the thirty [pieces] of silver and cast them unto the potter in the house of jehovah. then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel. and jehovah said unto me take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd. for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not visit those that are cut off neither will seek those that are scattered nor heal that which is broken nor feed that which is sound but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep] and will tear their hoofs in pieces. woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. the burden of the word of jehovah concerning israel. [thus] saith jehovah who stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him  behold i will make jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about and upon judah also shall it be in the siege against jerusalem. and it shall come to pass in that day that i will make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it. in that day saith jehovah i will smite every horse with terror and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness. and the chieftains of judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem are my strength in jehovah of hosts their god. in that day will i make the chieftains of judah like a pan of fire among wood and like a flaming torch among sheaves and they shall devour all the peoples round about on the right hand and on the left and [they of] jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place even in jerusalem. jehovah also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem be not magnified above judah.  in that day shall jehovah defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of jehovah before them. and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem. and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon. and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of the shimeites apart and their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart.  in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. and it shall come to pass in that day saith jehovah of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of jehovah and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he prophesieth neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive but he shall say i am no prophet i am a tiller of the ground for i have been made a bondman from my youth. and one shall say unto him what are these wounds between thine arms then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends.  awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith jehovah of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn my hand upon the little ones. and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith jehovah two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein. and i will bring the third part into the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried. they shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my people and they shall say jehovah is my god. behold a day of jehovah cometh when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. then shall jehovah go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battle.  and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west [and there shall be] a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south. and ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azel yea ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah and jehovah my god shall come and all the holy ones with thee. and it shall come to pass in that day that there shall not be light the bright ones shall withdraw themselves but it shall be one day which is known unto jehovah not day and not night but it shall come to pass that at evening time there shall be light.  and it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go out from jerusalem half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea in summer and in winter shall it be. and jehovah shall be king over all the earth in that day shall jehovah be one and his name one.  all the land shall be made like the arabah from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and she shall be lifted up and shall dwell in her place from benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate unto the corner gate and from the tower of hananel unto the kings wine presses. and men shall dwell therein and there shall be no more curse but jerusalem shall dwell safely. and this shall be the plague wherewith jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from jehovah shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.  and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in great abundance.  and so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps as that plague. and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations that came against jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king jehovah of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles. and it shall be that whoso of [all] the families of the earth goeth not up unto jerusalem to worship the king jehovah of hosts upon them there shall be no rain. and if the family of egypt go not up and come not neither [shall it be] upon them there shall be the plague wherewith jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses holy unto jehovah and the pots in jehovahs house shall be like the bowls before the altar.  yea every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holy unto jehovah of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and boil therein and in that day there shall be no more a canaanite in the house of jehovah of hosts. the burden of the word of jehovah to israel by malachi. i have loved you saith jehovah. yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacobs brother saith jehovah yet i loved jacob but esau i hated and made his mountains a desolation and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. whereas edom saith we are beaten down but we will return and build the waste places thus saith jehovah of hosts they shall build but i will throw down and men shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom jehovah hath indignation for ever. and your eyes shall see and ye shall say jehovah be magnified beyond the border of israel.  a son honoreth his father and a servant his master if then i am a father where is mine honor and if i am a master where is my fear saith jehovah of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name. and ye say wherein have we despised thy name ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of jehovah is contemptible. and when ye offer the blind for sacrifice it is no evil and when ye offer the lame and sick it is no evil present it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or will he accept thy person saith jehovah of hosts. and now i pray you entreat the favor of god that he may be gracious unto us this hath been by your means will he accept any of your persons saith jehovah of hosts. oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors that ye might not kindle [fire on] mine altar in vain i have no pleasure in you saith jehovah of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand.  for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the gentiles and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name [shall be] great among the gentiles saith jehovah of hosts. but ye profane it in that ye say the table of jehovah is polluted and the fruit thereof even its food is contemptible. ye say also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed at it saith jehovah of hosts and ye have brought that which was taken by violence and the lame and the sick thus ye bring the offering should i accept this at your hand saith jehovah. but cursed be the deceiver who hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a blemished thing for i am a great king saith jehovah of hosts and my name is terrible among the gentiles. and now o ye priests this commandment is for you. if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith jehovah of hosts then will i send the curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heart.  behold i will rebuke your seed and will spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your feasts and ye shall be taken away with it. and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant may be with levi saith jehovah of hosts. my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to him that he might fear and he feared me and stood in awe of my name. the law of truth was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and uprightness and turned many away from iniquity. for the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of jehovah of hosts. but ye are turned aside out of the way ye have caused many to stumble in the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith jehovah of hosts. therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have had respect of persons in the law.  have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother profaning the covenant of our fathers judah hath dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath profaned the holiness of jehovah which he loveth and hath married the daughter of a foreign god. jehovah will cut off to the man that doeth this him that waketh and him that answereth out of the tents of jacob and him that offereth an offering unto jehovah of hosts. and this again ye do ye cover the altar of jehovah with tears with weeping and with sighing insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more neither receiveth it with good will at your hand. yet ye say wherefore because jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously though she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.  and did he not make one although he had the residue of the spirit and wherefore one he sought a godly seed. therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. for i hate putting away saith jehovah the god of israel and him that covereth his garment with violence saith jehovah of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously. ye have wearied jehovah with your words. yet ye say wherein have we wearied him in that ye say every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of jehovah and he delighteth in them or where is the god of justice behold i send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple and the messenger of the covenant whom ye desire behold he cometh saith jehovah of hosts. but who can abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap  and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he will purify the sons of levi and refine them as gold and silver and they shall offer unto jehovah offerings in righteousness. then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto jehovah as in the days of old and as in ancient years. and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against the false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the sojourner [from his right] and fear not me saith jehovah of hosts. for i jehovah change not therefore ye o sons of jacob are not consumed. from the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances and have not kept them. return unto me and i will return unto you saith jehovah of hosts. but ye say wherein shall we return will a man rob god yet ye rob me. but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings. ye are cursed with the curse for ye rob me even this whole nation.  bring ye the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and prove me now herewith saith jehovah of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough [to receive it]. and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field saith jehovah of hosts. and all nations shall call you happy for ye shall be a delightsome land saith jehovah of hosts. your words have been stout against me saith jehovah. yet ye say what have we spoken against thee ye have said it is vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept his charge and that we have walked mournfully before jehovah of hosts and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are built up yea they tempt god and escape. then they that feared jehovah spake one with another and jehovah hearkened and heard and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared jehovah and that thought upon his name.  and they shall be mine saith jehovah of hosts [even] mine own possession in the day that i make and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not. for behold the day cometh it burneth as a furnace and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith jehovah of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings and ye shall go forth and gambol as calves of the stall. and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i make saith jehovah of hosts. remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel even statutes and ordinances. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of jehovah come.  and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse. the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham. abraham begat isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judah and his brethren and judah begat perez and zerah of tamar and perez begat hezron and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon and salmon begat boaz of rahab and boaz begat obed of ruth and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david the king. and david begat solomon of her [that had been the wife] of uriah and solomon begat rehoboam and rehoboam begat abijah and abijah begat asa and asa begat jehoshaphat and jehoshaphat begat joram and joram begat uzziah and uzziah begat jotham and jotham begat ahaz and ahaz begat hezekiah and hezekiah begat manasseh and manasseh begat amon and amon begat josiah and josiah begat jechoniah and his brethren at the time of the carrying away to babylon.  and after the carrying away to babylon jechoniah begat shealtiel and shealtiel begat zerubbabel and zerubbabel begat abiud and abiud begat eliakim and eliakim begat azor and azor begat sadoc and sadoc begat achim and achim begat eliud and eliud begat eleazar and eleazar begat matthan and matthan begat jacob and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ. so all the generations from abraham unto david are fourteen generations and from david unto the carrying away to babylon fourteen generations and from the carrying away to babylon unto the christ fourteen generations. now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when his mother mary had been betrothed to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy spirit. and joseph her husband being a righteous man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily.  but when he thought on these things behold an angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit. and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for it is he that shall save his people from their sins. now all this is come to pass that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet saying behold the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which is being interpreted god with us. and joseph arose from his sleep and did as the angel of the lord commanded him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth a son and he called his name jesus. now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold wisemen from the east came to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we saw his star in the east and are come to worship him. and when herod the king heard it he was troubled and all jerusalem with him.  and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the christ should be born. and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written through the prophet and thou bethlehem land of judah art in no wise least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come forth a governor who shall be shepherd of my people israel. then herod privily called the wisemen and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared. and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search out exactly concerning the young child and when ye have found [him] bring me word that i also may come and worship him. and they having heard the king went their way and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. and they came into the house and saw the young child with mary his mother and they fell down and worshipped him and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh.  and being warned [of god] in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way. now when they were departed behold an angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i tell thee for herod will seek the young child to destroy him. and he arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet saying out of egypt did i call my son. then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wisemen was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the male children that were in bethlehem and in all the borders thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had exactly learned of the wisemen. then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet saying a voice was heard in ramah weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and she would not be comforted because they are not.  but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead that sought the young childs life. and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel. but when he heard that archelaus was reigning over judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither and being warned [of god] in a dream he withdrew into the parts of galilee and came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he should be called a nazarene. and in those days cometh john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. for this is he that was spoken of through isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight. now john himself had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his food was locusts and wild honey.  then went out unto him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about the jordan and they were baptized of him in the river jordan confessing their sins. but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism he said unto them ye offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham. and even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. i indeed baptize you in water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and [in] fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshingfloor and he will gather his wheat into the garner but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. then cometh jesus from galilee to the jordan unto john to be baptized of him.  but john would have hindered him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me but jesus answering said unto him suffer [it] now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. then he suffereth him. and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway from the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending as a dove and coming upon him and lo a voice out of the heavens saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased. then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he afterward hungered. and the tempter came and said unto him if thou art the son of god command that these stones become bread. but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god. then the devil taketh him into the holy city and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple  and saith unto him if thou art the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. jesus said unto him again it is written thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god. again the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me. then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve.  then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him. now when he heard that john was delivered up he withdrew into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is by the sea in the borders of zebulun and naphtali that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali toward the sea beyond the jordan galilee of the gentiles  the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death to them did light spring up. from that time began jesus to preach and to say repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. and walking by the sea of galilee he saw two brethren simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers. and he saith unto them come ye after me and i will make you fishers of men. and they straightway left the nets and followed him. and going on from thence he saw two other brethren james the [son] of zebedee and john his brother in the boat with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them.  and they straightway left the boat and their father and followed him. and jesus went about in all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.  and the report of him went forth into all syria and they brought unto him all that were sick holden with divers diseases and torments possessed with demons and epileptic and palsied and he healed them. and there followed him great multitudes from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judaea and [from] beyond the jordan. and seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and when he had sat down his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted. blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth. blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled.  blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god. blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god. blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  blessed are ye when [men] shall reproach you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you. ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. ye are the light of the world. a city set on a hill cannot be hid. neither do [men] light a lamp and put it under the bushel but on the stand and it shineth unto all that are in the house. even so let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven. think not that i came to destroy the law or the prophets i came not to destroy but to fulfil. for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law till all things be accomplished.  whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. ye have heard that it was said to them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of the hell of fire. if therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift.  agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art with him in the way lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison. verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou have paid the last farthing. ye have heard that it was said thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. and if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body be cast into hell. and if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body go into hell. it was said also whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that every one that putteth away his wife saving for the cause of fornication maketh her an adulteress and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.  again ye have heard that it was said to them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but i say unto you swear not at all neither by the heaven for it is the throne of god nor by the earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king. neither shalt thou swear by thy head for thou canst not make one hair white or black. but let your speech be yea yea nay nay and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil [one]. ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you resist not him that is evil but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also. and if any man would go to law with thee and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also. and whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile go with him two. give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. ye have heard that it was said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you  that ye may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. for if ye love them that love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more [than others] do not even the gentiles the same ye therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be seen of them else ye have no reward with your father who is in heaven. when therefore thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men. verily i say unto you they have received their reward. but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.  and when ye pray ye shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. verily i say unto you they have received their reward. but thou when thou prayest enter into thine inner chamber and having shut thy door pray to thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee. and in praying use not vain repetitions as the gentiles do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him. after this manner therefore pray ye. our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come. thy will be done as in heaven so on earth. give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. and bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil [one.] for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you. but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses.  moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen of men to fast. verily i say unto you they have received their reward. but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face that thou be not seen of men to fast but of thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee. lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth consume and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where thy treasure is there will thy heart be also. the lamp of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light. but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness. if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is the darkness no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other. ye cannot serve god and mammon.  therefore i say unto you be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on. is not the life more than the food and the body than the raiment behold the birds of the heaven that they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns and your heavenly father feedeth them. are not ye of much more value then they and which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life and why are ye anxious concerning raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. but if god doth so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven [shall he] not much more [clothe] you o ye of little faith be not therefore anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. but seek ye first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you.  be not therefore anxious for the morrow for the morrow will be anxious for itself. sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. judge not that ye be not judged. for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you. and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me cast out the mote out of thine eye and lo the beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye. give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast your pearls before the swine lest haply they trample them under their feet and turn and rend you. ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. or what man is there of you who if his son shall ask him for a loaf will give him a stone or if he shall ask for a fish will give him a serpent  if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him all things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do ye also unto them for this is the law and the prophets. enter ye in by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many are they that enter in thereby. for narrow is the gate and straitened the way that leadeth unto life and few are they that find it. beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves. by their fruits ye shall know them. do [men] gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father who is in heaven. many will say to me in that day lord lord did we not prophesy by thy name and by thy name cast out demons and by thy name do many mighty works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity. every one therefore that heareth these words of mine and doeth them shall be likened unto a wise man who built his house upon the rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and if fell not for it was founded upon the rock. and every one that heareth these words of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and smote upon that house and it fell and great was the fall thereof. and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words the multitudes were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as [one] having authority and not as their scribes.  and when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him. and behold there came to him a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean. and he stretched forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou made clean. and straightway his leprosy was cleansed. and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them. and when he was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy grievously tormented. and he saith unto him i will come and heal him. and the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but only say the word and my servant shall be healed. for i also am a man under authority having under myself soldiers and i say to this one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it.  and when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel. and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way as thou hast believed [so] be it done unto thee. and the servant was healed in that hour. and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother lying sick of a fever. and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto him. and when even was come they brought unto him many possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our diseases. now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandments to depart unto the other side.  and there came a scribe and said unto him teacher i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven [have] nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head. and another of the disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father. but jesus saith unto him follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead. and when he was entered into a boat his disciples followed him. and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves but he was asleep. and they came to him and awoke him saying save lord we perish. and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm. and the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gadarenes there met him two possessed with demons coming forth out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man could pass by that way.  and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding. and the demons besought him saying if thou cast us out send us away into the herd of swine. and he said unto them go. and they came out and went into the swine and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea and perished in the waters. and they that fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons. and behold all the city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought [him] that he would depart from their borders. and he entered into a boat and crossed over and came into his own city. and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven. and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth. and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts  for which is easier to say thy sins are forgiven or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise and take up thy bed and go up unto thy house. and he arose and departed to his house. but when the multitudes saw it they were afraid and glorified god who had given such authority unto men. and as jesus passed by from thence he saw a man called matthew sitting at the place of toll and he saith unto him follow me. and he arose and followed him. and it came to pass as he sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with jesus and his disciples. and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your teacher with the publicans and sinners but when he heard it he said they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick. but go ye and learn what [this] meaneth i desire mercy and not sacrifice for i came not to call the righteous but sinners.  then come to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then will they fast. and no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment and a worse rent is made. neither do [men] put new wine into old wineskins else the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins perish but they put new wine into fresh wineskins and both are preserved. while he spake these things unto them behold there came a ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live. and jesus arose and followed him and [so did] his disciples. and behold a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the border of his garment  for she said within herself if i do but touch his garment i shall be made whole.  but jesus turning and seeing her said daughter be of good cheer thy faith hath made thee whole. and the woman was made whole from that hour. and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a tumult he said give place for the damsel is not dead but sleepeth. and they laughed him to scorn. but when the crowd was put forth he entered in and took her by the hand and the damsel arose. and the fame hereof went forth into all that land. and as jesus passed by from thence two blind men followed him crying out and saying have mercy on us thou son of david. and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they say unto him yea lord. then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it done unto you. and their eyes were opened. and jesus strictly charged them saying see that no man know it. but they went forth and spread abroad his fame in all that land.  and as they went forth behold there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.  and when the demon was cast out the dumb man spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel. but the pharisees said by the prince of the demons casteth he out demons. and jesus went about all the cities and the villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them because they were distressed and scattered as sheep not having a shepherd. then saith he unto his disciples the harvest indeed is plenteous but the laborers are few. pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers into his harvest. and he called unto him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the [son] of zebedee and john his brother  philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the [son] of alphaeus and thaddaeus simon the cananaean and judas iscariot who also betrayed him. these twelve jesus sent forth and charged them saying go not into [any] way of the gentiles and enter not into any city of the samaritans but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel. and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand. heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out demons freely ye received freely give. get you no gold nor silver nor brass in your purses no wallet for [your] journey neither two coats nor shoes nor staff for the laborer is worthy of his food. and into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter search out who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go forth. and as ye enter into the house salute it. and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you. and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words as ye go forth out of that house or that city shake off the dust of your feet.  verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves. but beware of men for they will deliver you up to councils and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake for a testimony to them and to the gentiles. but when they deliver you up be not anxious how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you. and brother shall deliver up brother to death and the father his child and children shall rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved. but when they persecute you in this city flee into the next for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone through the cities of israel till the son of man be come. a disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his lord.  it is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher and the servant as his lord. if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more them of his household fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known. what i tell you in the darkness speak ye in the light and what ye hear in the ear proclaim upon the housetops. and be not afraid of them that kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. are not two sparrows sold for a penny and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows. every one therefore who shall confess me before men him will i also confess before my father who is in heaven. but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven. think not that i came to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword.  for i came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans foes [shall be] they of his own household. he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward. and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward. and it came to pass when jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.  now when john heard in the prison the works of the christ he sent by his disciples and said unto him art thou he that cometh or look we for another and jesus answered and said unto them go and tell john the things which ye hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear and the dead are raised up and the poor have good tidings preached to them. and blessed is he whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. and as these went their way jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to behold a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft [raiment] behold they that wear soft [raiment] are in kings houses. but wherefore went ye out to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet. this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee.  verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than john the baptist yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and men of violence take it by force. for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john. and if ye are willing to receive [it] this is elijah that is to come. he that hath ears to hear let him hear. but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces who call unto their fellows and say we piped unto you and ye did not dance we wailed and ye did not mourn. for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a demon. the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners and wisdom is justified by her works. then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not.  woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the day of judgment than for you. and thou capernaum shalt thou be exalted unto heaven thou shalt go down unto hades for if the mighty works had been done in sodom which were done in thee it would have remained until this day. but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee. at that season jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding and didst reveal them unto babes yea father for so it was well pleasing in thy sight. all things have been delivered unto me of my father and no one knoweth the son save the father neither doth any know the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son willeth to reveal [him.] come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest.  take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls. for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. at that season jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat. but the pharisees when they saw it said unto him behold thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath. but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was hungry and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god and ate the showbread which it was not lawful for him to eat neither for them that were with him but only for the priests or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are guiltless but i say unto you that one greater than the temple is here. but if ye had known what this meaneth i desire mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless. for the son of man is lord of the sabbath. and he departed thence and went into their synagogue  and behold a man having a withered hand. and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day that they might accuse him. and he said unto them what man shall there be of you that shall have one sheep and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out how much then is a man of more value than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day. then saith he to the man stretch forth thy hand. and he stretched it forth and it was restored whole as the other. but the pharisees went out and took counsel against him how they might destroy him. and jesus perceiving [it] withdrew from thence and many followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall declare judgment to the gentiles. he shall not strive nor cry aloud neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.  a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory. and in his name shall the gentiles hope. then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw. and all the multitudes were amazed and said can this be the son of david but when the pharisees heard it they said this man doth not cast out demons but by beelzebub the prince of the demons. and knowing their thoughts he said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan casteth out satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand and if i by beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges. but if i by the spirit of god cast out demons then is the kingdom of god come upon you. or how can one enter into the house of the strong [man] and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong [man] and then he will spoil his house.  he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. therefore i say unto you every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the spirit shall not be forgiven. and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever shall speak against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in that which is to come. either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit. ye offspring of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. the good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. and i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered him saying teacher we would see a sign from thee.  but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonah the prophet for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. the men of nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and behold a greater than jonah is here. the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here. but the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passeth through waterless places seeking rest and findeth it not. then he saith i will return into my house whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished.  then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. even so shall it be also unto this evil generation. while he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and his brethren stood without seeking to speak to him. and one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without seeking to speak to thee. but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren and he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father who is in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother. on that day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side. and there were gathered unto him great multitudes so that he entered into a boat and sat and all the multitude stood on the beach. and he spake to them many things in parables saying behold the sower went forth to sow and as he sowed some [seeds] fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured them  and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth and straightway they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was risen they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away. and others fell upon the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them and others fell upon the good ground and yielded fruit some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty. he that hath ears let him hear. and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given. for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. therefore speak i to them in parables because seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand. and unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall in no wise understand and seeing ye shall see and shall in no wise perceive  for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest haply they should perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should turn again and i should heal them. but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see and saw them not and to hear the things which ye hear and heard them not. hear then ye the parable of the sower. when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not [then] cometh the evil [one] and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. this is he that was sown by the way side. and he that was sown upon the rocky places this is he that heareth the word and straightway with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but endureth for a while and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word straightway he stumbleth.  and he that was sown among the thorns this is he that heareth the word and the care of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful. and he that was sown upon the good ground this is he that heareth the word and understandeth it who verily beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty. another parable set he before them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat and went away. but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also. and the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence then hath it tares and he said unto them an enemy hath done this. and the servants say unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he saith nay lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up the wheat with them.  let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather up first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn. another parable set he before them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is less than all seeds but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened. all these things spake jesus in parables unto the multitudes and without a parable spake he nothing unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. then he left the multitudes and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  and he answered and said he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world and the good seed these are the sons of the kingdom and the tares are the sons of the evil [one]  and the enemy that sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are angels. as therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire so shall it be in the end of the world. the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and them that do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father. he that hath ears let him hear. the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field. again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls and having found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and bought it.  again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was filled they drew up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels but the bad they cast away.  so shall it be in the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. have ye understood all these things they say unto him yea. and he said unto them therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. and it came to pass when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence. and coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works  is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joseph and simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him. but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house. and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  at that season herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning jesus and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers work in him. for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of herodias his brother philips wife. for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her. and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet. but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced in the midst and pleased herod. whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.  and she being put forward by her mother saith give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist. and the king was grieved but for the sake of his oaths and of them that sat at meat with him he commanded it to be given and he sent and beheaded john in the prison. and his head was brought on a platter and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother. and his disciples came and took up the corpse and buried him and they went and told jesus. now when jesus heard [it] he withdrew from thence in a boat to a desert place apart and when the multitudes heard [thereof] they followed him on foot from the cities. and he came forth and saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. and when even was come the disciples came to him saying the place is desert and the time is already past send the multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food. but jesus said unto them they have no need to go away give ye them to eat. and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes. and he said bring them hither to me.  and he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes. and they all ate and were filled and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full. and they that did eat were about five thousand men besides women and children. and straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before him unto the other side till he should send the multitudes away. and after he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray and when even was come he was there alone. but the boat was now in the midst of the sea distressed by the waves for the wind was contrary. and in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them walking upon the sea. and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a ghost and they cried out for fear. but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid.  and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto the upon the waters. and he said come. and peter went down from the boat and walked upon the waters to come to jesus. but when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying lord save me. and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and took hold of him and saith unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were gone up into the boat the wind ceased. and they that were in the boat worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god. and when they had crossed over they came to the land unto gennesaret. and when the men of that place knew him they sent into all that region round about and brought unto him all that were sick and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment and as many as touched were made whole. then there come to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.  and he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god because of your tradition for god said honor thy father and thy mother and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the death. but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given [to god] he shall not honor his father. and ye have made void the word of god because of your tradition. ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me. but in vain do they worship me teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. and he called to him the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man but that which proceedeth out of the mouth this defileth the man. then came the disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended when they heard this saying but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father planted not shall be rooted up.  let them alone they are blind guides. and if the blind guide the blind both shall fall into a pit. and peter answered and said unto him declare unto us the parable. and he said are ye also even yet without understanding perceive ye not that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught but the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart and they defile the man. for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness railings these are the things which defile the man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man. and jesus went out thence and withdrew into the parts of tyre and sidon. and behold a canaanitish woman came out from those borders and cried saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon. but he answered her not a word. and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us. but he answered and said i was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel.  but she came and worshipped him saying lord help me. and he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs. but she said yea lord for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table. then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. and her daughter was healed from that hour. and jesus departed thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and he went up into the mountain and sat there. and there came unto him great multitudes having with them the lame blind dumb maimed and many others and they cast them down at this feet and he healed them insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb speaking the maimed whole and lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the god of israel. and jesus called unto him his disciples and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i would not send them away fasting lest haply they faint on the way.  and the disciples say unto him whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude and jesus said unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few small fishes. and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and he gave thanks and brake and gave to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes. and they all ate and were filled and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces seven baskets full. and they that did eat were four thousand men besides women and children. and he sent away the multitudes and entered into the boat and came into the borders of magadan. and the pharisees and sadducees came and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven. but he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say [it will be] fair weather for the heaven is red. and in the morning [it will be] foul weather today for the heaven is red and lowering. ye know how to discern the face of the heaven but ye cannot [discern] the signs of the times.  an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of jonah. and he left them and departed. and the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread. and jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees. and they reasoned among themselves saying we took no bread. and jesus perceiving it said o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have no bread do ye not yet perceive neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up how is it that ye do not perceive that i spake not to you concerning bread but beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees. then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees. now when jesus came into the parts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that the son of man is  and they said some [say] john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets. he saith unto them but who say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god. and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father who is in heaven. and i also say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it. i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the christ. from that time began jesus to show unto his disciples that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up. and peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall never be unto thee.  but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art a stumblingblock unto me for thou mindest not the things of god but the things of men. then said jesus unto his disciples if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. for whosoever would save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. for what shall a man be profited if he shall gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what shall a man give in exchange for his life for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds. verily i say unto you there are some of them that stand here who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his garments became white as the light. and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him.  and peter answered and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt i will make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah. while he was yet speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him. and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid. and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid. and lifting up their eyes they saw no one save jesus only. and as they were coming down from the mountain jesus commanded them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen from the dead. and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elijah must first come and he answered and said elijah indeed cometh and shall restore all things but i say into you that elijah is come already and they knew him not but did unto him whatsoever they would. even so shall the son of man also suffer of them. then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of john the baptist.  and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a man kneeling to him saying lord have mercy on my son for he is epileptic and suffereth grievously for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and offtimes into the water. and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him. and jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i bear with you bring him hither to me. and jesus rebuked him and the demon went out of him and the boy was cured from that hour. then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast it out and he saith unto them because of your little faith for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you. [but this kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting.] and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised up. and they were exceeding sorry.  and when they were come to capernaum they that received the halfshekel came to peter and said doth not your teacher pay the halfshekel he saith yea. and when he came into the house jesus spake first to him saying what thinkest thou simon the kings of the earth from whom do they receive toll or tribute from their sons or from strangers and when he said from strangers jesus said unto him therefore the sons are free. but lest we cause them to stumble go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a shekel that take and give unto them for me and thee. in that hour came the disciples unto jesus saying who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and he called to him a little child and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye turn and become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me  but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck and [that] he should be sunk in the depth of the sea. woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling for it must needs be that the occasions come but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh and if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble cut it off and cast it from thee it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. and if thine eye causeth thee to stumble pluck it out and cast it from thee it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. see that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father who is in heaven. [for the son of man came to save that which was lost.] how think ye if any man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and go unto the mountains and seek that which goeth astray  and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray. even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. and if thy brother sin against thee go show him his fault between thee and him alone if he hear thee thou hast gained thy brother. but if he hear [thee] not take with thee one or two more that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established. and if he refuse to hear them tell it unto the church and if he refuse to hear the church also let him be unto thee as the gentile and the publican. verily i say unto you what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father who is in heaven. for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them. then came peter and said to him lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him until seven times  jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven. therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king who would make a reckoning with his servants. and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him that owed him ten thousand talents. but forasmuch as he had not [wherewith] to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made. the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all. and the lord of that servant being moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt. but that servant went out and found one of his fellowservants who owed him a hundred shillings and he laid hold on him and took [him] by the throat saying pay what thou owest. so his fellow servant fell down and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee. and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay that which was due.  so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were exceeding sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  then his lord called him unto him and saith to him thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellowservant even as i had mercy on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due. so shall also my heavenly father do unto you if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts. and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words he departed from galilee and came into the borders of judaea beyond the jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there. and there came unto him pharisees trying him and saying is it lawful [for a man] to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said have ye not read that he who made [them] from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh  so that they are no more two but one flesh. what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder. they say unto him why then did moses command to give a bill of divorcement and to put [her] away  he saith unto them moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it hath not been so. and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery. the disciples say unto him if the case of the man is so with his wife it is not expedient to marry. but he said unto them not all men can receive this saying but they to whom it is given. for there are eunuchs that were so born from their mothers womb and there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake. he that is able to receive it let him receive it. then were there brought unto him little children that he should lay his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them.  but jesus said suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven. and he laid his hands on them and departed thence.  and behold one came to him and said teacher what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why askest thou me concerning that which is good one there is who is good but if thou wouldest enter into life keep the commandments. he saith unto him which and jesus said thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. the young man saith unto him all these things have i observed what lack i yet jesus said unto him if thou wouldest be perfect go sell that which thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me. but when the young man heard the saying he went away sorrowful for he was one that had great possessions.  and jesus said unto his disciples verily i say unto you it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god. and when the disciples heard it they were astonished exceedingly saying who then can be saved and jesus looking upon [them] said to them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible. then answered peter and said unto him lo we have left all and followed thee what then shall we have and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye who have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel. and every one that hath left houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my names sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life. but many shall be last [that are] first and first [that are] last.  for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. and when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day he sent them into his vineyard. and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace idle and to them he said go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you. and they went their way. again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise. and about the eleventh [hour] he went out and found others standing and he saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle they say unto him because no man hath hired us. he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard. and when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the laborers and pay them their hire beginning from the last unto the first. and when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour they received every man a shilling. and when the first came they supposed that they would receive more and they likewise received every man a shilling.  and when they received it they murmured against the householder saying these last have spent [but] one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat. but he answered and said to one of them friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a shilling take up that which is thine and go thy way it is my will to give unto this last even as unto thee. is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own or is thine eye evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last. and as jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples apart and on the way he said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him unto the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify and the third day he shall be raised up. then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with her sons worshipping [him] and asking a certain thing of him.  and he said unto her what wouldest thou she saith unto him command that these my two sons may sit one on thy right hand and one on thy left hand in thy kingdom. but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask. are ye able to drink the cup that i am about to drink they say unto him we are able. he saith unto them my cup indeed ye shall drink but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left hand is not mine to give but [it is for them] for whom it hath been prepared of my father. and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren. but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them. not so shall it be among you but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. and as they went out from jericho a great multitude followed him.  and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus was passing by cried out saying lord have mercy on us thou son of david. and the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace but they cried out the more saying lord have mercy on us thou son of david. and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i should do unto you they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened. and jesus being moved with compassion touched their eyes and straightway they received their sight and followed him. and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and came unto bethphage unto the mount of olives then jesus sent two disciples saying unto them go into the village that is over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose [them] and bring [them] unto me. and if any one say aught unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them. now this is come to pass that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying  tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass. and the disciples went and did even as jesus appointed them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their garments and he sat thereon. and the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the way. and the multitudes that went before him and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest. and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was stirred saying who is this and the multitudes said this is the prophet jesus from nazareth of galilee. and jesus entered into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of he moneychangers and the seats of them that sold the doves and he saith unto them it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but ye make it a den of robbers.  and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them. but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children that were crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were moved with indignation and said unto him hearest thou what these are saying and jesus saith unto them yea did ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise and he left them and went forth out of the city to bethany and lodged there. now in the morning as he returned to the city he hungered. and seeing a fig tree by the way side he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and he saith unto it let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. and immediately the fig tree withered away. and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how did the fig tree immediately wither away and jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree but even if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou taken up and cast into the sea it shall be done.  and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive. and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one question which if ye tell me i likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things. the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or from men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why then did ye not believe him but if we shall say from men we fear the multitude for all hold john as a prophet. and they answered jesus and said we know not. he also said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things. but what think ye a man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work today in the vineyard. and he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented himself and went. and he came to the second and said likewise. and he answered and said i [go] sir and went not.  which of the two did the will of his father they say the first. jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you. for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye saw it did not even repent yourselves afterward that ye might believe him. hear another parable there was a man that was a householder who planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country. and when the season of the fruits drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits. and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another. again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them in like manner. but afterward he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son. but the husbandmen when they saw the son said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and take his inheritance.  and they took him and cast him forth out of the vineyard and killed him. when therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come what will he do unto those husbandmen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those miserable men and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall render him the fruits in their seasons. jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner this was from the lord and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken away from you and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. and he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will scatter him as dust. and when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them. and when they sought to lay hold on him they feared the multitudes because they took him for a prophet. and jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them saying  the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast and they would not come. again he sent forth other servants saying tell them that are bidden behold i have made ready my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come to the marriage feast. but they made light of it and went their ways one to his own farm another to his merchandise and the rest laid hold on his servants and treated them shamefully and killed them. but the king was wroth and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they that were bidden were not worthy. go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage feast. and those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was filled with guests. but when the king came in to behold the guests he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment  and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless. then the king said to the servants bind him hand and foot and cast him out into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. for many are called but few chosen. then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might ensnare him in [his] talk. and they send to him their disciples with the herodians saying teacher we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth and carest not for any one for thou regardest not the person of men. tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why make ye trial of me ye hypocrites show me the tribute money. and they brought unto him a denarius. and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription they say unto him caesars. then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods. and when they heard it they marvelled and left him and went away.  on that day there came to him sadducees they that say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying teacher moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. now there were with us seven brethren and the first married and deceased and having no seed left his wife unto his brother in like manner the second also and the third unto the seventh. and after them all the woman died. in the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her. but jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god. for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as angels in heaven. but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not [the god] of the dead but of the living. and when the multitudes heard it they were astonished at his teaching.  but the pharisees when they heard that he had put the sadducees to silence gathered themselves together. and one of them a lawyer asked him a question trying him teacher which is the great commandment in the law and he said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind. this is the great and first commandment. and a second like [unto it] is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. on these two commandments the whole law hangeth and the prophets. now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them a question saying what think ye of the christ whose son is he they say unto him [the son] of david. he saith unto them how then doth david in the spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i put thine enemies underneath thy feet if david then calleth him lord how is he his son and no one was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. then spake jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples  saying the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat all things therefore whatsoever they bid you [these] do and observe but do not ye after their works for they say and do not. yea they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with their finger. but all their works they do to be seen of men for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders [of their garments] and love the chief place at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called of men rabbi. but be not ye called rabbi for one is your teacher and all ye are brethren. and call no man your father on the earth for one is your father [even] he who is in heaven. neither be ye called masters for one is your master [even] the christ. but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.  but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men for ye enter not in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter[.] woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses even while for a pretence ye make long prayers therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation. woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is become so ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves. woe unto you ye blind guides that say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor. ye fools and blind for which is greater the gold or the temple that hath sanctified the gold and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is a debtor. ye blind for which is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift he therefore that sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon.  and he that sweareth by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein. and he that sweareth by the heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon.  woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin and have left undone the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith but these ye ought to have done and not to have left the other undone. ye blind guides that strain out the gnat and swallow the camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full from extortion and excess. thou blind pharisee cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside thereof may become clean also. woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness. even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and garnish the tombs of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  wherefore ye witness to yourselves that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets. fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. ye serpents ye offspring of vipers how shall ye escape the judgment of hell therefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them shall ye kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of abel the righteous unto the blood of zachariah son of barachiah whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar. verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation.  o jerusalem jerusalem that killeth the prophets and stoneth them that are sent unto her how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate. for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the lord.  and jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple. but he answered and said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. and as he sat on the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what [shall be] the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man lead you astray. for many shall come in my name saying i am the christ and shall lead many astray.  and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for [these things] must needs come to pass but the end is not yet. for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places. but all these things are the beginning of travail. then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my names sake. and then shall many stumble and shall deliver up one another and shall hate one another. and many false prophets shall arise and shall lead many astray. and because iniquity shall be multiplied the love of the many shall wax cold. but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved. and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations and then shall the end come. when therefore ye see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let him that readeth understand then let them that are in judaea flee unto the mountains  let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak. but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on a sabbath for then shall be great tribulation such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now no nor ever shall be. and except those days had been shortened no flesh would have been saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened. then if any man shall say unto you lo here is the christ or here believe [it] not. for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the elect. behold i have told you beforehand. if therefore they shall say unto you behold he is in the wilderness go not forth behold he is in the inner chambers believe [it] not. for as the lightning cometh forth from the east and is seen even unto the west so shall be the coming of the son of man.  wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together. but immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. and he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other. now from the fig tree learn her parable when her branch is now become tender and putteth forth its leaves ye know that the summer is nigh even so ye also when ye see all these things know ye that he is nigh [even] at the doors. verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all these things be accomplished. heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away.  but of that day and hour knoweth no one not even the angels of heaven neither the son but the father only. and as [were] the days of noah so shall be the coming of the son of man. for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall be the coming of the son of man. then shall two man be in the field one is taken and one is left two women [shall be] grinding at the mill one is taken and one is left. watch therefore for ye know not on what day your lord cometh. but know this that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. therefore be ye also ready for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh. who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath set over his household to give them their food in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  verily i say unto you that he will set him over all that he hath. but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord tarrieth and shall begin to beat his fellow servants and shall eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not and in an hour when he knoweth not and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. and five of them were foolish and five were wise. for the foolish when they took their lamps took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. now while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept. but at midnight there is a cry behold the bridegroom come ye forth to meet him. then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out.  but the wise answered saying peradventure there will not be enough for us and you go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. and while they went away to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut. afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us. but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not. watch therefore for ye know not the day nor the hour. for [it is] as [when] a man going into another country called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods. and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his several ability and he went on his journey. straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them and made other five talents. in like manner he also that [received] the two gained other two. but he that received the one went away and digged in the earth and hid his lords money. now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and maketh a reckoning with them.  and he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents lo i have gained other five talents. his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will set thee over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord. and he also that [received] the two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents lo i have gained other two talents. his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will set thee over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord. and he also that had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art a hard man reaping where thou didst not sow and gathering where thou didst not scatter and i was afraid and went away and hid thy talent in the earth lo thou hast thine own. but his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i did not scatter thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers and at my coming i should have received back mine own with interest.  take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away. and cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. but when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the angels with him then shall he sit on the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left. then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and ye gave me to eat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me.  then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee hungry and fed thee or athirst and gave thee drink and when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee and when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren [even] these least ye did it unto me. then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and ye did not give me to eat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not. then shall they also answer saying lord when saw we thee hungry or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least ye did it not unto me. and these shall go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life.  and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these words he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days the passover cometh and the son of man is delivered up to be crucified. then were gathered together the chief priests and the elders of the people unto the court of the high priest who was called caiaphas and they took counsel together that they might take jesus by subtlety and kill him. but they said not during the feast lest a tumult arise among people. now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment and she poured it upon his head as he sat at meat. but when the disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this [ointment] might have been sold for much and given to the poor. but jesus perceiving it said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me. for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always. for in that she poured this ointment upon my body she did it to prepare me for burial.  verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said what are ye willing to give me and i will deliver him unto you and they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver. and from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [unto them.] now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the teacher saith my time is at hand i keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. and the disciples did as jesus appointed them and they made ready the passover. now when even was come he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples and as they were eating he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me. and they were exceeding sorrowful and began to say unto him every one is it i lord  and he answered and said he that dipped his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me. the son of man goeth even as it is written of him but woe unto that man through whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had not been born. and judas who betrayed him answered and said is it i rabbi he saith unto him thou hast said. and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and he gave to the disciples and said take eat this is my body. and he took a cup and gave thanks and gave to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many unto remission of sins. but i say unto you i shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom. and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives. then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended in me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. but after i am raised up i will go before you into galilee.  but peter answered and said unto him if all shall be offended in thee i will never be offended. jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. peter saith unto him even if i must die with thee [yet] will i not deny thee. likewise also said all the disciples. then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto his disciples sit ye here while i go yonder and pray. and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death abide ye here and watch with me. and he went forward a little and fell on his face and prayed saying my father if it be possible let this cup pass away from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt. and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.  again a second time he went away and prayed saying my father if this cannot pass away except i drink it thy will be done. and he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy. and he left them again and went away and prayed a third time saying again the same words. then cometh he to the disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. arise let us be going behold he is at hand that betrayeth me. and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priest and elders of the people. now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that is he take him. and straightway he came to jesus and said hail rabbi and kissed him. and jesus said unto him friend [do] that for which thou art come. then they came and laid hands on jesus and took him. and behold one of them that were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his ear.  then saith jesus unto him put up again thy sword into its place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. or thinkest thou that i cannot beseech my father and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels how then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be in that hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me i sat daily in the temple teaching and ye took me not. but all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. then all the disciples left him and fled. and they that had taken jesus led him away to [the house of] caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. but peter followed him afar off unto the court of the high priest and entered in and sat with the officers to see the end. now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against jesus that they might put him to death and they found it not though many false witnesses came. but afterward came two  and said this man said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days. and the high priest stood up and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace. and the high priest said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou art the christ the son of god. jesus said unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you henceforth ye shall see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven. then the high priest rent his garments saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is worthy of death. then did they spit in his face and buffet him and some smote him with the palms of their hands saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that struck thee now peter was sitting without in the court and a maid came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus the galilaean. but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest.  and when he was gone out into the porch another [maid] saw him and saith unto them that were there this man also was with jesus of nazareth. and again he denied with an oath i know not the man. and after a little while they that stood by came and said to peter of a truth thou also art [one] of them for thy speech maketh thee known. then began he to curse and to swear i know not the man. and straightway the cock crew.  and peter remembered the word which jesus had said before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. and he went out and wept bitterly. now when morning was come all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death and they bound him and led him away and delivered him up to pilate the governor. then judas who betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i betrayed innocent blood. but they said what is that to us see thou [to it].  and he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and departed and he went away and hanged himself. and the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury since it is the price of blood. and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in. wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day. then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was priced whom [certain] of the children of israel did price  and they gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me. now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest. and when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing. then saith pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee and he gave him no answer not even to one word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner whom they would.  and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas. when therefore they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus who is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him up. and while he was sitting on the judgmentseat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that righteous man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for barabbas and destroy jesus.  but the governor answered and said unto them which of the two will ye that i release unto you and they said barabbas. pilate saith unto them what then shall i do unto jesus who is called christ they all say let him be crucified. and he said why what evil hath he done but they cried out exceedingly saying let him be crucified. so when pilate saw that he prevailed nothing but rather that a tumult was arising he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this righteous man see ye [to it].  and all the people answered and said his blood [be] on us and on our children. then released he unto them barabbas but jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified. then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the praetorium and gathered unto him the whole band. and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe. and they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spat upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head. and when they had mocked him they took off from him the robe and put on him his garments and led him away to crucify him. and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to go [with them] that he might bear his cross. and they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say the place of a skull they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted it he would not drink. and when they had crucified him they parted his garments among them casting lots  and they sat and watched him there. and they set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews. then are there crucified with him two robbers one on the right hand and one on the left. and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou art the son of god come down from the cross. in like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save. he is the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe on him. he trusteth on god let him deliver him now if he desireth him for he said i am the son of god. and the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach. now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them stood there when they heard it said this man calleth elijah.  and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink. and the rest said let be let us see whether elijah cometh to save him. and jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. and behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks were rent and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. now the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done feared exceedingly saying truly this was the son of god. and many women were there beholding from afar who had followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of the sons of zebedee.  and when even was come there came a rich man from arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus. then pilate commanded it to be given up. and joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed. and mary magdalene was there and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre. now on the morrow which is [the day] after the preparation the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i rise again. command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest haply his disciples come and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first. pilate said unto them ye have a guard go make it [as] sure as ye can. so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone the guard being with them.  now late on the sabbath day as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre. and behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. his appearance was as lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the watchers did quake and became as dead men. and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus who hath been crucified. he is not here for he is risen even as he said. come see the place where the lord lay. and go quickly and tell his disciples he is risen from the dead and lo he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you. and they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word. and behold jesus met them saying all hail. and they came and took hold of his feet and worshipped him. then saith jesus unto them fear not go tell my brethren that they depart into galilee and there shall they see me.  now while they were going behold some of the guard came into the city and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave much money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and rid you of care. so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying was spread abroad among the jews [and continueth] until this day. but the eleven disciples went into galilee unto the mountain where jesus had appointed them. and when they saw him they worshipped [him] but some doubted. and jesus came to them and spake unto them saying all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. go ye therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world.  the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god. even as it is written in isaiah the prophet behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way. the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight john came who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins. and there went out unto him all the country of judaea and all they of jerusalem and they were baptized of him in the river jordan confessing their sins. and john was clothed with camels hair and [had] a leathern girdle about his loins and did eat locusts and wild honey. and he preached saying there cometh after me he that is mightier than i the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. i baptized you in water but he shall baptize you in the holy spirit. and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in the jordan. and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens rent asunder and the spirit as a dove descending upon him  and a voice came out of the heavens thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased. and straightway the spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. and he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him. now after john was delivered up jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe in the gospel. and passing along by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net in the sea for they were fishers. and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men. and straightway they left the nets and followed him. and going on a little further he saw james the [son] of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the boat mending the nets. and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him. and they go into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.  and they were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as having authority and not as the scribes. and straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou nazarene art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god. and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him. and the unclean spirit tearing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him. and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what is this a new teaching with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him. and the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of galilee round about. and straightway when they were come out of the synagogue they came into the house of simon and andrew with james and john. now simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and straightway they tell him of her and he came and took her by the hand and raised her up and the fever left her and she ministered unto them.  and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were sick and them that were possessed with demons. and all the city was gathered together at the door. and he healed many that were sick with divers diseases and cast out many demons and he suffered not the demons to speak because they knew him. and in the morning a great while before day he rose up and went out and departed into a desert place and there prayed. and simon and they that were with him followed after him and they found him and say unto him all are seeking thee. and he saith unto them let us go elsewhere into the next towns that i may preach there also for to this end came i forth. and he went into their synagogues throughout all galilee preaching and casting out demons. and there cometh to him a leper beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean. and being moved with compassion he stretched forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou made clean. and straightway the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean.  and he strictly charged him and straightway sent him out and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing the things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them. but he went out and began to publish it much and to spread abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into a city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter. and when he entered again into capernaum after some days it was noised that he was in the house. and many were gathered together so that there was no longer room [for them] no not even about the door and he spake the word unto them. and they come bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy borne of four. and when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. and jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins are forgiven. but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts  why doth this man thus speak he blasphemeth who can forgive sins but one [even] god and straightway jesus perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves saith unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts which is easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins are forgiven or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise take up thy bed and go unto thy house. and he arose and straightway took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion. and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them. and as he passed by he saw levi the [son] of alphaeus sitting at the place of toll and he saith unto him follow me. and he arose and followed him. and it came to pass that he was sitting at meat in his house and many publicans and sinners sat down with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him.  and the scribes of the pharisees when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans said unto his disciples [how is it] that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners and when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners. and johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting and they come and say unto him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then will they fast in that day. no man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment else that which should fill it up taketh from it the new from the old and a worse rent is made. and no man putteth new wine into old wineskins else the wine will burst the skins and the wine perisheth and the skins but [they put] new wine into fresh wineskins.  and it came to pass that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears. and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful and he said unto them did ye never read what david did when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the showbread which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests and gave also to them that were with him and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath. and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there who had his hand withered. and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him. and he saith unto the man that had his hand withered stand forth. and he saith unto them is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good or to do harm to save a life or to kill but they held their peace.  and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved at the hardening of their heart he saith unto the man stretch forth thy hand. and he stretched it forth and his hand was restored. and the pharisees went out and straightway with the herodians took counsel against him how they might destroy him. and jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed and from judaea and from jerusalem and from idumaea and beyond the jordan and about tyre and sidon a great multitude hearing what great things he did came unto him. and he spake to his disciples that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd lest they should throng him for he had healed many insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him. and the unclean spirits whensoever they beheld him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god. and he charged them much that they should not make him known. and he goeth up into the mountain and calleth unto him whom he himself would and they went unto him.  and he appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have authority to cast out demons and simon he surnamed peter and james the [son] of zebedee and john the brother of james and them he surnamed boanerges which is sons of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the [son] of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the cananaean and judas iscariot who also betrayed him. and he cometh into a house. and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread. and when his friends heard it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself. and the scribes that came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons. and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand. and if a house be divided against itself that house will not be able to stand.  and if satan hath rise up against himself and is divided he cannot stand but hath an end. but no one can enter into the house of the strong [man] and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong [man] and then he will spoil his house. verily i say unto you all their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme  but whosoever shall blaspheme against the holy spirit hath never forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin because they said he hath an unclean spirit. and there come his mother and his brethren and standing without they sent unto him calling him. and a multitude was sitting about him and they say unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. and he answereth them and saith who is my mother and my brethren and looking round on them that sat round about him he saith behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and sister and mother.  and again he began to teach by the sea side. and there is gathered unto him a very great multitude so that he entered into a boat and sat in the sea and all the multitude were by the sea on the land. and he taught them many things in parables and said unto them in his teaching hearken behold the sower went forth to sow and it came to pass as he sowed some [seed] fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured it. and other fell on the rocky [ground] where it had not much earth and straightway it sprang up because it had no deepness of earth  and when the sun was risen it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away. and other fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit. and others fell into the good ground and yielded fruit growing up and increasing and brought forth thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold. and he said who hath ears to hear let him hear. and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.  and he said unto them unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest haply they should turn again and it should be forgiven them. and he saith unto them know ye not this parable and how shall ye know all the parables the sower soweth the word. and these are they by the way side where the word is sown and when they have heard straightway cometh satan and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.  and these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky [places] who when they have heard the word straightway receive it with joy and they have no root in themselves but endure for a while then when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word straightway they stumble. and others are they that are sown among the thorns these are they that have heard the word and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful.  and those are they that were sown upon the good ground such as hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold. and he said unto them is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed [and] not to be put on the stand for there is nothing hid save that it should be manifested neither was [anything] made secret but that it should come to light. if any man hath ears to hear let him hear. and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you and more shall be given unto you. for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed upon the earth and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring up and grow he knoweth not how. the earth beareth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear. but when the fruit is ripe straightway he putteth forth the sickle because the harvest is come.  and he said how shall we liken the kingdom of god or in what parable shall we set it forth it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown upon the earth though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth yet when it is sown groweth up and becometh greater than all the herbs and putteth out great branches so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof. and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it and without a parable spake he not unto them but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things. and on that day when even was come he saith unto them let us go over unto the other side. and leaving the multitude they take him with them even as he was in the boat. and other boats were with him. and there ariseth a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the boat insomuch that the boat was now filling. and he himself was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they awake him and say unto him teacher carest thou not that we perish  and he awoke and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still. and the wind ceased and there was a great calm. and he said unto them why are ye fearful have ye not yet faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him and they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the gerasenes. and when he was come out of the boat straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling in the tombs and no man could any more bind him no not with a chain because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been rent asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces and no man had strength to tame him. and always night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones. and when he saw jesus from afar he ran and worshipped him and crying out with a loud voice he saith what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god torment me not.  for he said unto him come forth thou unclean spirit out of the man. and he asked him what is thy name and he saith unto him my name is legion for we are many. and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. and they besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them. and he gave them leave. and the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea [in number] about two thousand and they were drowned in the sea. and they that fed them fled and told it in the city and in the country. and they came to see what it was that had come to pass. and they come to jesus and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting clothed and in his right mind [even] him that had the legion and they were afraid. and they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons and concerning the swine. and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.  and as he was entering into the boat he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. and he suffered him not but saith unto him go to thy house unto thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and [how] he had mercy on thee. and he went his way and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men marvelled. and when jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side a great multitude was gathered unto him and he was by the sea. and there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and seeing him he falleth at his feet and beseecheth him much saying my little daughter is at the point of death [i pray thee] that thou come and lay thy hands on her that she may be made whole and live. and he went with him and a great multitude followed him and they thronged him. and a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse  having heard the things concerning jesus came in the crowd behind and touched his garment. for she said if i touch but his garments i shall be made whole. and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague. and straightway jesus perceiving in himself that the power [proceeding] from him had gone forth turned him about in the crowd and said who touched my garments and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what had been done to her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth. and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague. while he yet spake they come from the ruler of the synagogues [house] saying thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the teacher any further but jesus not heeding the word spoken saith unto the ruler of the synagogue fear not only believe.  and he suffered no man to follow with him save peter and james and john the brother of james. and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he beholdeth a tumult and [many] weeping and wailing greatly. and when he was entered in he saith unto them why make ye a tumult and weep the child is not dead but sleepeth. and they laughed him to scorn. but he having put them all forth taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him and goeth in where the child was. and taking the child by the hand he saith unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise. and straightway the damsel rose up and walked for she was twelve years old. and they were amazed straightway with a great amazement. and he charged them much that no man should know this and he commanded that [something] should be given her to eat. and he went out from thence and he cometh into his own country and his disciples follow him.  and when the sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying whence hath this man these things and what is the wisdom that is given unto this man and [what mean] such mighty works wrought by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended in him. and jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house. and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them. and he marvelled because of their unbelief. and he went round about the villages teaching. and he calleth unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits and he charged them that they should take nothing for [their] journey save a staff only no bread no wallet now money in their purse but [to go] shod with sandals and [said he] put not on two coats.  and he said unto them wheresoever ye enter into a house there abide till ye depart thence. and whatsoever place shall not receive you and they hear you not as ye go forth thence shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them. and they went out and preached that [men] should repent. and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them. and king herod heard [thereof] for his name had become known and he said john the baptizer is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers work in him. but others said it is elijah. and others said [it is] a prophet [even] as one of the prophets. but herod when he heard [thereof] said john whom i beheaded he is risen. for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for the sake of herodias his brother philips wife for he had married her. for john said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife. and herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him and she could not  for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and kept him safe. and when he heard him he was much perplexed and he heard him gladly. and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords and the high captains and the chief men of galilee and when the daughter of herodias herself came in and danced she pleased herod and them that sat at meat with him and the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee. and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom. and she went out and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptizer. and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of john the baptist. and the king was exceeding sorry but for the sake of his oaths and of them that sat at meat he would not reject her. and straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring his head and he went and beheaded him in the prison  and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother. and when his disciples heard [thereof] they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb. and the apostles gather themselves together unto jesus and they told him all things whatsoever they had done and whatsoever they had taught. and he saith unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while. for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat. and they went away in the boat to a desert place apart. and [the people] saw them going and many knew [them] and they ran together there on foot from all the cities and outwent them. and he came forth and saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things. and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said the place is desert and the day is now far spent send them away that they may go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves somewhat to eat.  but he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat. and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and give them to eat and he saith unto them how many loaves have ye go [and] see. and when they knew they say five and two fishes. and he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass. and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties. and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake the loaves and he gave to the disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all. and they all ate and were filled. and they took up broken pieces twelve basketfuls and also of the fishes. and they that ate the loaves were five thousand men. and straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat and to go before [him] unto the other side to bethsaida while he himself sendeth the multitude away. and after he had taken leave of them he departed into the mountain to pray. and when even was come the boat was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land.  and seeing them distressed in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking on the sea and he would have passed by them but they when they saw him walking on the sea supposed that it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled. but he straightway spake with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid. and he went up unto them into the boat and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves for they understood not concerning the loaves but their heart was hardened. and when they had crossed over they came to the land unto gennesaret and moored to the shore. and when they were come out of the boat straightway [the people] knew him and ran round about that whole region and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick where they heard he was.  and wheresoever he entered into villages or into cities or into the country they laid the sick in the marketplaces and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole. and there are gathered together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from jerusalem and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled that is unwashen hands. for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands diligently eat not holding the tradition of the elders and [when they come] from the marketplace except they bathe themselves they eat not and many other things there are which they have received to hold washings of cups and pots and brasen vessels. and the pharisees and the scribes ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with defiled hands and he said unto them well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me.  but in vain do they worship me teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. ye leave the commandment of god and hold fast the tradition of men. and he said unto them full well do ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your tradition. for moses said honor thy father and thy mother and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the death but ye say if a man shall say to his father or his mother that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is corban that is to say given [to god] ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother making void the word of god by your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things ye do. and he called to him the multitude again and said unto them hear me all of you and understand there is nothing from without the man that going into him can defile him but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. [if any man hath ears to hear let him hear.] and when he was entered into the house from the multitude his disciples asked of him the parable.  and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also perceive ye not that whatsoever from without goeth into the man [it] cannot defile him because it goeth not into his heart but into his belly and goeth out into the draught [this he said] making all meats clean. and he said that which proceedeth out of the man that defileth the man. for from within out of the heart of men evil thoughts proceed fornications thefts murders adulteries covetings wickednesses deceit lasciviousness an evil eye railing pride foolishness all these evil things proceed from within and defile the man. and from thence he arose and went away into the borders of tyre and sidon. and he entered into a house and would have no man know it and he could not be hid. but straightway a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having heard of him came and fell down at his feet. now the woman was a greek a syrophoenician by race. and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.  and he said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs. but she answered and saith unto him yea lord even the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs. and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the demon is gone out of thy daughter. and she went away unto her house and found the child laid upon the bed and the demon gone out. and again he went out from the borders of tyre and came through sidon unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the borders of decapolis. and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him. and he took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue  and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened. and his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain. and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it.  and they were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh even the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. in those days when there was again a great multitude and they had nothing to eat he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and if i send them away fasting to their home they will faint on the way and some of them are come from far. and his disciples answered him whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven. and he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and having given thanks he brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they set them before the multitude.  and they had a few small fishes and having blessed them he commanded to set these also before them. and they ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that remained over seven baskets.  and they were about four thousand and he sent them away. and straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha. and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven trying him. and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation. and he left them and again entering into [the boat] departed to the other side. and they forgot to take bread and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf. and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod. and they reasoned one with another saying we have no bread. and jesus perceiving it saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread do ye not yet perceive neither understand have ye your heart hardened  having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember  when i brake the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up they say unto him twelve. and when the seven among the four thousand how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up and they say unto him seven. and he said unto them do ye not yet understand and they come unto bethsaida. and they bring to him a blind man and beseech him to touch him. and he took hold of the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him he asked him seest thou aught and he looked up and said i see men for i behold [them] as trees walking. then again he laid his hands upon his eyes and he looked stedfastly and was restored and saw all things clearly. and he sent him away to his home saying do not even enter into the village. and jesus went forth and his disciples into the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples saying unto them who do men say that i am and they told him saying john the baptist and others elijah but others one of the prophets.  and he asked them but who say ye that i am peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ. and he charged them that they should tell no man of him. and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again. and he spake the saying openly. and peter took him and began to rebuke him. but he turning about and seeing his disciples rebuked peter and saith get thee behind me satan for thou mindest not the things of god but the things of men. and he called unto him the multitude with his disciples and said unto them if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. for whosoever would save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels shall save it. for what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life for what should a man give in exchange for his life  for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man also shall be ashamed of him when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels. and he said unto them verily i say unto you there are some here of them that stand [by] who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the kingdom of god come with power. and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his garments became glistering exceeding white so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. and there appeared unto them elijah with moses and they were talking with jesus. and peter answereth and saith to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah. for he knew not what to answer for they became sore afraid. and there came a cloud overshadowing them and there came a voice out of the cloud this is my beloved son hear ye him.  and suddenly looking round about they saw no one any more save jesus only with themselves. and as they were coming down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen save when the son of man should have risen again from the dead. and they kept the saying questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean. and they asked him saying [how is it] that the scribes say that elijah must first come and he said unto them elijah indeed cometh first and restoreth all things and how is it written of the son of man that he should suffer many things and be set at nought but i say unto you that elijah is come and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would even as it is written of him. and when they came to the disciples they saw a great multitude about them and scribes questioning with them. and straightway all the multitude when they saw him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him. and he asked them what question ye with them  and one of the multitude answered him teacher i brought unto thee my son who hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever it taketh him it dasheth him down and he foameth and grindeth his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out and they were not able. and he answereth them and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i bear with you bring him unto me. and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him grievously and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming. and he asked his father how long time is it since this hath come unto him and he said from a child. and ofttimes it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us. and jesus said unto him if thou canst all things are possible to him that believeth. straightway the father of the child cried out and said i believe help thou mine unbelief.  and when jesus saw that a multitude came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i command thee come out of him and enter no more into him. and having cried out and torn him much he came out and [the boy] became as one dead insomuch that the more part said he is dead. but jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he arose. and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately [how is it] that we could not cast it out and he said unto them this kind can come out by nothing save by prayer. and they went forth from thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it. for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered up into the hands of men and they shall kill him and when he is killed after three days he shall rise again. but they understood not the saying and were afraid to ask him. and they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were ye reasoning on the way but they held their peace for they had disputed one with another on the way who [was] the greatest.  and he sat down and called the twelve and he saith unto them if any man would be first he shall be last of all and servant of all. and he took a little child and set him in the midst of them and taking him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth not me but him that sent me. john said unto him teacher we saw one casting out demons in thy name and we forbade him because he followed not us. but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name and be able quickly to speak evil of me. for he that is not against us is for us. for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink because ye are christs verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward. and whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea. and if thy hand cause thee to stumble cut it off it is good for thee to enter into life maimed rather than having thy two hands to go into hell into the unquenchable fire.  [where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.] and if thy foot cause thee to stumble cut it off it is good for thee to enter into life halt rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell. [where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.] and if thine eye cause thee to stumble cast it out it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. for every one shall be salted with fire. salt is good but if the salt have lost its saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and be at peace one with another. and he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of judaea and beyond the jordan and multitudes come together unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again. and there came unto him pharisees and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife trying him. and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away.  but jesus said unto them for your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. but from the beginning of the creation male and female made he them. for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so that they are no more two but one flesh. what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder. and in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter. and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if she herself shall put away her husband and marry another she committeth adultery. and they were bringing unto him little children that he should touch them and the disciples rebuked them. but when jesus saw it he was moved with indignation and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me forbid them not for to such belongeth the kingdom of god. verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall in no wise enter therein. and he took them in his arms and blessed them laying his hands upon them.  and as he was going forth into the way there ran one to him and kneeled to him and asked him good teacher what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one [even] god. thou knowest the commandments do not kill do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor thy father and mother. and he said unto him teacher all these things have i observed from my youth. and jesus looking upon him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me. but his countenance fell at the saying and he went away sorrowful for he was one that had great possessions. and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god and the disciples were amazed at his words. but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god  it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god. and they were astonished exceedingly saying unto him then who can be saved jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god. peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee. jesus said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the gospels sake but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life. but many [that are] first shall be last and the last first. and they were on the way going up to jerusalem and jesus was going before them and they were amazed and they that followed were afraid. and he took again the twelve and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him  [saying] behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him unto the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall spit upon him and shall scourge him and shall kill him and after three days he shall rise again. and there come near unto him james and john the sons of zebedee saying unto him teacher we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee. and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you and they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and one on [thy] left hand in thy glory. but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask. are ye able to drink the cup that i drink or to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and they said unto him we are able. and jesus said unto them the cup that i drink ye shall drink and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand or on [my] left hand is not mine to give but [it is for them] for whom it hath been prepared.  and when the ten heard it they began to be moved with indignation concerning james and john. and jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them. but it is not so among you but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister and whosoever would be first among you shall be servant of all. for the son of man also came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. and they come to jericho and as he went out from jericho with his disciples and a great multitude the son of timaeus bartimaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the way side. and when he heard that it was jesus the nazarene he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me. and many rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me. and jesus stood still and said call ye him. and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good cheer rise he calleth thee.  and he casting away his garment sprang up and came to jesus. and jesus answered him and said what wilt thou that i should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him rabboni that i may receive my sight. and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole. and straightway he received his sight and followed him in the way. and when they draw nigh unto jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village that is over against you and straightway as ye enter into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat loose him and bring him. and if any one say unto you why do ye this say ye the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him back hither. and they went away and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street and they loose him. and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt and they said unto them even as jesus had said and they let them go.  and they bring the colt unto jesus and cast on him their garments and he sat upon him. and many spread their garments upon the way and others branches which they had cut from the fields. and they that went before and they that followed cried hosanna blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed [is] the kingdom that cometh [the kingdom] of our father david hosanna in the highest. and he entered into jerusalem into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things it being now eventide he went out unto bethany with the twelve. and on the morrow when they were come out from bethany he hungered. and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs. and he answered and said unto it no man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. and his disciples heard it.  and they come to jerusalem and he entered into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold the doves and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. and he taught and said unto them is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations but ye have made it a den of robbers. and the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. and every evening he went forth out of the city. and as they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him rabbi behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god. verily i say unto you whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou taken up and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass he shall have it.  therefore i say unto you all things whatsoever ye pray and ask for believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them. and whensoever ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against any one that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. [but if ye do not forgive neither will your father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.] and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and they said unto him by what authority doest thou these things or who gave thee this authority to do these things and jesus said unto them i will ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things. the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men answer me. and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him but should we say from men they feared the people for all verily held john to be a prophet.  and they answered jesus and say we know not. and jesus saith unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things.  and he began to speak unto them in parables. a man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and digged a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country. and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. and they took him and beat him and sent him away empty. and again he sent unto them another servant and him they wounded in the head and handled shamefully. and he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some. he had yet one a beloved son he sent him last unto them saying they will reverence my son. but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours. and they took him and killed him and cast him forth out of the vineyard.  what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others. have ye not read even this scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner  this was from the lord and it is marvellous in our eyes and they sought to lay hold on him and they feared the multitude for they perceived that he spake the parable against them and they left him and went away. and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians that they might catch him in talk. and when they were come they say unto him teacher we know that thou art true and carest not for any one for thou regardest not the person of men but of a truth teachest the way of god is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why make ye trial of me bring me a denarius that i may see it. and they brought it. and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesars.  and jesus said unto them render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods. and they marvelled greatly at him. and there come unto him sadducees who say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying  teacher moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave a wife behind him and leave no child that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed and the second took her and died leaving no seed behind him and the third likewise and the seven left no seed. last of all the woman also died. in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife. jesus said unto them is it not for this cause that ye err that ye know not the scriptures nor the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as angels in heaven.  but as touching the dead that they are raised have ye not read in the book of moses in [the place concerning] the bush how god spake unto him saying i [am] the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living ye do greatly err. and one of the scribes came and heard them questioning together and knowing that he had answered them well asked him what commandment is the first of all jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength. the second is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. there is none other commandment greater than these. and the scribe said unto him of a truth teacher thou hast well said that he is one and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god. and no man after that durst ask him any question. and jesus answered and said as he taught in the temple how say the scribes that the christ is the son of david david himself said in the holy spirit the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. david himself calleth him lord and whence is he his son and the common people heard him gladly. and in his teaching he said beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and [to have] salutations in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts they that devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater condemnation. and he sat down over against the treasury and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much. and there came a poor widow and she cast in two mites which make a farthing.  and he called unto him his disciples and said unto them verily i say unto you this poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury for they all did cast in of their superfluity but she of her want did cast in all that she had [even] all her living. and as he went forth out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him teacher behold what manner of stones and what manner of buildings and jesus said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down. and as he sat on the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately tell us when shall these things be and what [shall be] the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished and jesus began to say unto them take heed that no man lead you astray. many shall come in my name saying i am [he] and shall lead many astray. and when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be not troubled [these things] must needs come to pass but the end is not yet.  for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there shall be earthquakes in divers places there shall be famines these things are the beginning of travail. but take ye heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in synagogues shall ye be beaten and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake for a testimony unto them. and the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations. and when they lead you [to judgment] and deliver you up be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy spirit. and brother shall deliver up brother to death and the father his child and children shall rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved. but when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that are in judaea flee unto the mountains  and let him that is on the housetop not go down nor enter in to take anything out his house and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak. but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that it be not in the winter. for those days shall be tribulation such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which god created until now and never shall be. and except the lord had shortened the days no flesh would have been saved but for the elects sake whom he chose he shortened the days. and then if any man shall say unto you lo here is the christ or lo there believe [it] not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show signs and wonders that they may lead astray if possible the elect. but take ye heed behold i have told you all things beforehand. but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall be falling from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.  and then shall they see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. and then shall he send forth the angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. now from the fig tree learn her parable when her branch is now become tender and putteth forth its leaves ye know that the summer is nigh even so ye also when ye see these things coming to pass know ye that he is nigh [even] at the doors. verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away until all these things be accomplished. heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away. but of that day or that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven neither the son but the father. take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is. [it is] as [when] a man sojourning in another country having left his house and given authority to his servants to each one his work commanded also the porter to watch. watch therefore for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh whether at even or at midnight or at cockcrowing or in the morning  lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. and what i say unto you i say unto all watch. now after two days was [the feast of] the passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety and kill him for they said not during the feast lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people. and while he was in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly [and] she brake the cruse and poured it over his head. but there were some that had indignation among themselves [saying] to what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made for this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings and given to the poor. and they murmured against her. but jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me. for ye have the poor always with you and whensoever ye will ye can do them good but me ye have not always. she hath done what she could she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.  and verily i say unto you wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. and judas iscariot he that was one of the twelve went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him unto them. and they when they heard it were glad and promised to give him money. and he sought how he might conveniently deliver him [unto them]. and on the first day of unleavened bread when they sacrificed the passover his disciples say unto him where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover and he sendeth two of his disciples and saith unto them go into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall enter in say to the master of the house the teacher saith where is my guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will himself show you a large upper room furnished [and] ready and there make ready for us.  and the disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover. and when it was evening he cometh with the twelve. and as they sat and were eating jesus said verily i say unto you one of you shall betray me [even] he that eateth with me. they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and he said unto them [it is] one of the twelve he that dippeth with me in the dish. for the son of man goeth even as it is written of him but woe unto that man through whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had not been born. and as they were eating he took bread and when he had blessed he brake it and gave to them and said take ye this is my body. and he took a cup and when he had given thanks he gave to them and they all drank of it. and he said unto them this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many. verily i say unto you i shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god. and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives.  and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered abroad. howbeit after i am raised up i will go before you into galilee. but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i. and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that thou today [even] this night before the cock crow twice shalt deny me thrice. but he spake exceedingly vehemently if i must die with thee i will not deny thee. and in like manner also said they all. and they come unto a place which was named gethsemane and he saith unto his disciples sit ye here while i pray. and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be greatly amazed and sore troubled. and he saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death abide ye here and watch. and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass away from him. and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee remove this cup from me howbeit not what i will but what thou wilt.  and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest thou not watch one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak. and again he went away and prayed saying the same words. and again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they knew not what to answer him. and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. arise let us be going behold he that betrayeth me is at hand. and straightway while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. now he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that is he take him and lead him away safely. and when he was come straightway he came to him and saith rabbi and kissed him. and they laid hands on him and took him. but a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword and smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his ear.  and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but [this is done] that the scriptures might be fulfilled. and they all left him and fled. and a certain young man followed with him having a linen cloth cast about him over [his] naked [body] and they lay hold on him but he left the linen cloth and fled naked. and they led jesus away to the high priest and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. and peter had followed him afar off even within into the court of the high priest and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [of the fire]. now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against jesus to put him to death and found it not. for many bare false witness against him and their witness agreed not together. and there stood up certain and bare false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another made without hands.  and not even so did their witness agree together. and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing. again the high priest asked him and saith unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven. and the high priest rent his clothes and saith what further need have we of witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be worthy of death. and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the officers received him with blows of their hands. and as peter was beneath in the court there cometh one of the maids of the high priest and seeing peter warming himself she looked upon him and saith thou also wast with the nazarene [even] jesus. but he denied saying i neither know nor understand what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew.  and the maid saw him and began again to say to them that stood by this is [one] of them. but he again denied it. and after a little while again they that stood by said to peter of a truth thou art [one] of them for thou art a galilaean. but he began to curse and to swear i know not this man of whom ye speak. and straightway the second time the cock crew. and peter called to mind the word how that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice. and when he thought thereon he wept. and straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council held a consultation and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him up to pilate. and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering saith unto him thou sayest. and the chief priests accused him of many things. and pilate again asked him saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they accuse thee of. but jesus no more answered anything insomuch that pilate marvelled. now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner whom they asked of him.  and there was one called barabbas [lying] bound with them that had made insurrection men who in the insurrection had committed murder. and the multitude went up and began to ask him [to do] as he was wont to do unto them. and pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. but the chief priests stirred up the multitude that he should rather release barabbas unto them. and pilate again answered and said unto them what then shall i do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews and they cried out again crucify him. and pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done but they cried out exceedingly crucify him. and pilate wishing to content the multitude released unto them barabbas and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified. and the soldiers led him away within the court which is the praetorium and they call together the whole band. and they clothe him with purple and platting a crown of thorns they put it on him  and they began to salute him hail king of the jews and they smote his head with a reed and spat upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him. and when they had mocked him they took off from him the purple and put on him his garments. and they lead him out to crucify him. and they compel one passing by simon of cyrene coming from the country the father of alexander and rufus to go [with them] that he might bear his cross. and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull. and they offered him wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not. and they crucify him and part his garments among them casting lots upon them what each should take. and it was the third hour and they crucified him. and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews. and with him they crucify two robbers one on his right hand and one on his left. [and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was reckoned with transgressors.]  and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ha thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself and come down from the cross. in like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] among themselves with the scribes said he saved others himself he cannot save.  let the christ the king of israel now come down from the cross that we may see and believe. and they that were crucified with him reproached him. and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elijah. and one ran and filling a sponge full of vinegar put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let be let us see whether elijah cometh to take him down. and jesus uttered a loud voice and gave up the ghost. and the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.  and when the centurion who stood by over against him saw that he so gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god. and there were also women beholding from afar among whom [were] both mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome who when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women that came up with him unto jerusalem.  and when even was now come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath there came joseph of arimathaea a councillor of honorable estate who also himself was looking for the kingdom of god and he boldly went in unto pilate and asked for the body of jesus. and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead. and when he learned it of the centurion he granted the corpse to joseph. and he bought a linen cloth and taking him down wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.  and mary magdalene and mary the [mother] of joses beheld where he was laid. and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the [mother] of james and salome bought spices that they might come and anoint him. and very early on the first day of the week they come to the tomb when the sun was risen. and they were saying among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb  and looking up they see that the stone is rolled back for it was exceeding great. and entering into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side arrayed in a white robe and they were amazed. and he saith unto them be not amazed ye seek jesus the nazarene who hath been crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and peter he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you. and they went out and fled from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had come upon them and they said nothing to any one for they were afraid.  now when he was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons. she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept. and they when they heard that he was alive and had been seen of her disbelieved. and after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them as they walked on their way into the country. and they went away and told it unto the rest neither believed they them. and afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. and these signs shall accompany them that believe in my name shall they cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall in no wise hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.  so then the lord jesus after he had spoken unto them was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god. and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed. amen. forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us even as they delivered them unto us who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having traced the course of all things accurately from the first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed. there was in the days of herod king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abijah and he had a wife of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth. and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless.  and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were [now] well stricken in years. now it came to pass while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to enter into the temple of the lord and burn incense. and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense. and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of altar of incense. and zacharias was troubled when he saw [him] and fear fell upon him. but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias because thy supplication is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john. and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth. for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy spirit even from his mothers womb. and many of the children of israel shall be turn unto the lord their god.  and he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient [to walk] in the wisdom of the just to make ready for the lord a people prepared [for him]. and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years. and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and i was sent to speak unto thee and to bring thee these good tidings. and behold thou shalt be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to pass because thou believedst not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season. and the people were waiting for zacharias and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple. and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple and he continued making signs unto them and remained dumb. and it came to pass when the days of his ministration were fulfilled he departed unto his house.  and after these days elisabeth his wife conceived and she hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men. now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary. and he came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the lord [is] with thee. but she was greatly troubled at the saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god. and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus. he shall be great and shall be called the son of the most high and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end. and mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man  and the angel answered and said unto her the holy spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the son of god. and behold elisabeth thy kinswoman she also hath conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren. for no word from god shall be void of power. and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word. and the angel departed from her. and mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth. and it came to pass when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy spirit and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said blessed [art] thou among women and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb. and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come unto me for behold when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy.  and blessed [is] she that believed for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the lord. and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour. for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name. and his mercy is unto generations and generations on them that fear him. he hath showed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart. he hath put down princes from [their] thrones and hath exalted them of low degree. the hungry he hath filled with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away. he hath given help to israel his servant that he might remember mercy as he spake unto our fathers toward abraham and his seed for ever. and mary abode with her about three months and returned unto her house. now elisabeths time was fulfilled that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son.  and her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the lord had magnified his mercy towards her and they rejoiced with her. and it came to pass on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child and they would have called him zacharias after the name of the father. and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john. and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. and they made signs to his father what he would have him called. and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote saying his name is john. and they marvelled all. and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue [loosed] and he spake blessing god. and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea. and all that heard them laid them up in their heart saying what then shall this child be for the hand of the lord was with him. and his father zacharias was filled with the holy spirit and prophesied saying  blessed [be] the lord the god of israel for he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to show mercy towards our fathers and to remember his holy covenant the oath which he spake unto abraham our father to grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. yea and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the most high for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to make ready his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people in the remission of their sins because of the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us to shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace.  and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto israel. now it came to pass in those days there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be enrolled. this was the first enrolment made when quirinius was governor of syria. and all went to enrol themselves every one to his own city. and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea to the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and family of david to enrol himself with mary who was betrothed to him being great with child. and it came to pass while they were there the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. and she brought forth her firstborn son and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. and there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field and keeping watch by night over their flock. and an angel of the lord stood by them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid.  and the angel said unto them be not afraid for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people for there is born to you this day in the city of david a saviour who is christ the lord. and this [is] the sign unto you ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased. and it came to pass when the angels went away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing that is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us. and they came with haste and found both mary and joseph and the babe lying in the manger. and when they saw it they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. and all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. but mary kept all these sayings pondering them in her heart.  and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen even as it was spoken unto them. and when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him his name was called jesus which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. and when the days of their purification according to the law of moses were fulfilled they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and this man was righteous and devout looking for the consolation of israel and the holy spirit was upon him. and it had been revealed unto him by the holy spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ.  and he came in the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law then he received him into his arms and blessed god and said now lettest thou thy servant depart lord according to thy word in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel. and his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this [child] is set for the falling and the rising of many in israel and for a sign which is spoken against yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher she was of a great age having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity  and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years who departed not from the temple worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. and coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto god and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of jerusalem. and when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth. and the child grew and waxed strong filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him. and his parents went every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover. and when he was twelve years old they went up after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they were returning the boy jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and his parents knew it not but supposing him to be in the company they went a days journey and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they returned to jerusalem seeking for him.  and it came to pass after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. and when they saw him they were astonished and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i sought thee sorrowing. and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me knew ye not that i must be in my fathers house and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. and he went down with them and came to nazareth and he was subject unto them and his mother kept all [these] sayings in her heart. and jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men. now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of the region of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias tetrarch of abilene  in the highpriesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness. and he came into all the region round about the jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight. every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god. he said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him ye offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham. and even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. and the multitudes asked him saying what then must we do  and he answered and said unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath food let him do likewise. and there came also publicans to be baptized and they said unto him teacher what must we do and he said unto them extort no more than that which is appointed you. and soldiers also asked him saying and we what must we do and he said unto them extort from no man by violence neither accuse [any one] wrongfully and be content with your wages. and as the people were in expectation and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning john whether haply he were the christ john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but there cometh he that is mightier than i the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and [in] fire  whose fan is in his hand thoroughly to cleanse his threshingfloor and to gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. with many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people  but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brothers wife and for all the evil things which herod had done added this also to them all that he shut up john in prison. now it came to pass when all the people were baptized that jesus also having been baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him and a voice came out of heaven thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased. and jesus himself when he began [to teach] was about thirty years of age being the son as was supposed of joseph the [son] of heli the [son] of matthat the [son] of levi the [son] of melchi the [son] of jannai the [son] of joseph the [son] of mattathias the [son] of amos the [son] of nahum the [son] of esli the [son] of naggai the [son] of maath the [son] of mattathias the [son] of semein the [son] of josech the [son] of joda  the [son] of joanan the [son] of rhesa the [son] of zerubbabel the [son] of shealtiel the [son] of neri the [son] of melchi the [son] of addi the [son] of cosam the [son] of elmadam the [son] of er  the [son] of jesus the [son] of eliezer the son of jorim the [son] of matthat the [son] of levi the [son] of symeon the [son] of judas the [son] of joseph the [son] of jonam the [son] of eliakim the [son] of melea the [son] of menna the [son] of mattatha the [son] of nathan the [son] of david the [son] of jesse the [son] of obed the [son] of boaz the [son] of salmon the [son] of nahshon the [son] of amminadab the [son] of arni the [son] of hezron the [son] of perez the [son] of judah the [son] of jacob the [son] of isaac the [son] of abraham the [son] of terah the [son] of nahor the [son] of serug the [son] of reu the [son] of peleg the [son] of eber the [son] of shelah the [son] of cainan the [son] of arphaxad the [son] of shem the [son] of noah the [son] of lamech the [son] of methuselah the [son] of enoch the [son] of jared the [son] of mahalaleel the [son] of cainan  the [son] of enos the [son] of seth the [son] of adam the [son] of god. and jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led in the spirit in the wilderness  during forty days being tempted of the devil. and he did eat nothing in those days and when they were completed he hungered. and the devil said unto him if thou art the son of god command this stone that it become bread. and jesus answered unto him it is written man shall not live by bread alone. and he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. and the devil said unto him to thee will i give all this authority and the glory of them for it hath been delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it. if thou therefore wilt worship before me it shall all be thine. and jesus answered and said unto him it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve. and he led him to jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou art the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee to guard thee and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god.  and when the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season. and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about. and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and he entered as his custom was into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up to read. and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah. and he opened the book and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor he hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord. and he closed the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. and he began to say unto them today hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.  and all bare him witness and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son and he said unto them doubtless ye will say unto me this parable physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done at capernaum do also here in thine own country. and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is acceptable in his own country. but of a truth i say unto you there were many widows in israel in the days of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when there came a great famine over all the land and unto none of them was elijah sent but only to zarephath in the land of sidon unto a woman that was a widow. and there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed but only naaman the syrian. and they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things and they rose up and cast him forth out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might throw him down headlong. but he passing through the midst of them went his way.  and he came down to capernaum a city of galilee. and he was teaching them on the sabbath day and they were astonished at his teaching for his word was with authority. and in the synagogue there was a man that had a spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice ah what have we to do with thee jesus thou nazarene art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god. and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him. and when the demon had thrown him down in the midst he came out of him having done him no hurt. and amazement came upon all and they spake together one with another saying what is this word for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out. and there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about. and he rose up from the synagogue and entered into the house of simon. and simons wifes mother was holden with a great fever and they besought him for her.  and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them. and when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. and demons also came out from many crying out and saying thou art the son of god. and rebuking them he suffered them not to speak because they knew that he was the christ. and when it was day he came out and went into a desert place and the multitudes sought after him and came unto him and would have stayed him that he should not go from them. but he said unto them i must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for therefore was i sent. and he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee. now it came to pass while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of god that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret and he saw two boats standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.  and he entered into one of the boats which was simons and asked him to put out a little from the land. and he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat. and when he had left speaking he said unto simon put out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught. and simon answered and said master we toiled all night and took nothing but at thy word i will let down the nets. and when they had done this they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their nets were breaking and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them. and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink. but simon peter when he saw it fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord. for he was amazed and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken and so were also james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon. and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men. and when they had brought their boats to land they left all and followed him.  and it came to pass while he was in one of the cities behold a man full of leprosy and when he saw jesus he fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean. and he stretched forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou made clean. and straightway the leprosy departed from him. and he charged him to tell no man but go thy way and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them. but so much the more went abroad the report concerning him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities. but he withdrew himself in the deserts and prayed. and it came to pass on one of those days that he was teaching and there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by who were come out of every village of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal. and behold men bring on a bed a man that was palsied and they sought to bring him in and to lay him before him.  and not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before jesus. and seeing their faith he said man thy sins are forgiven thee. and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this that speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone but jesus perceiving their reasonings answered and said unto them why reason ye in your hearts which is easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins he said unto him that was palsied i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go unto thy house. and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his house glorifying god. and amazement took hold on all and they glorified god and they were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day. and after these things he went forth and beheld a publican named levi sitting at the place of toll and said unto him follow me.  and he forsook all and rose up and followed him. and levi made him a great feast in his house and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them. and the pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners and jesus answering said unto them they that are in health have no need of a physician but they that are sick. i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. and they said unto him the disciples of john fast often and make supplications likewise also the [disciples] of the pharisees but thine eat and drink. and jesus said unto them can ye make the sons of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them but the days will come and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them then will they fast in those days. and he spake also a parable unto them no man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment else he will rend the new and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.  and no man putteth new wine into old wine skins else the new wine will burst the skins and itself will be spilled and the skins will perish. but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. and no man having drunk old [wine] desireth new for he saith the old is good. now it came to pass on a sabbath that he was going through the grainfields and his disciples plucked the ears and did eat rubbing them in their hands. but certain of the pharisees said why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day and jesus answering them said have ye not read even this what david did when he was hungry he and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god and took and ate the showbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone and he said unto them the son of man is lord of the sabbath. and it came to pass on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man there and his right hand was withered. and the scribes and the pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath that they might find how to accuse him.  but he knew their thoughts and he said to the man that had his hand withered rise up and stand forth in the midst. and he arose and stood forth. and jesus said unto them i ask you is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to destroy it and he looked round about on them all and said unto him stretch forth thy hand. and he did [so] and his hand was restored. but they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus. and it came to pass in these days that he went out into the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to god. and when it was day he called his disciples and he chose from them twelve whom also he named apostles simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james [the son] of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas [the son] of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor  and he came down with them and stood on a level place and a great multitude of his disciples and a great number of the people from all judaea and jerusalem and the sea coast of tyre and sidon who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. and all the multitude sought to touch him for power came forth from him and healed [them] all. and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed [are] ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god. blessed [are] ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled. blessed [are] ye that weep now for ye shall laugh. blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you [from their company] and reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of mans sake. rejoice in that day and leap [for joy] for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets. but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation. woe unto you ye that are full now for ye shall hunger. woe [unto you] ye that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep.  woe [unto you] when all men shall speak well of you for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets. but i say unto you that hear love your enemies do good to them that hate you bless them that curse you pray for them that despitefully use you. to him that smiteth thee on the [one] cheek offer also the other and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also. give to every one that asketh thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise. and if ye love them that love you what thank have ye for even sinners love those that love them. and if ye do good to them that do good to you what thank have ye for even sinners do the same. and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much. but love your enemies and do [them] good and lend never despairing and your reward shall be great and ye shall be sons of the most high for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. be ye merciful even as your father is merciful.  and judge not and ye shall not be judged and condemn not and ye shall not be condemned release and ye shall be released give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall they give into your bosom. for with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again. and he spake also a parable unto them can the blind guide the blind shall they not both fall into a pit the disciple is not above his teacher but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher. and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brothers eye. for there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.  for each tree is known by its own fruit. for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. the good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and the evil [man] out of the evil [treasure] bringeth forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say every one that cometh unto me and heareth my words and doeth them i will show you to whom he is like he is like a man building a house who digged and went deep and laid a foundation upon the rock and when a flood arose the stream brake against that house and could not shake it because it had been well builded. but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the stream brake and straightway it fell in and the ruin of that house was great. after he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people he entered into capernaum. and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and at the point of death.  and when he heard concerning jesus he sent unto him elders of the jews asking him that he would come and save his servant. and they when they came to jesus besought him earnestly saying he is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him for he loveth our nation and himself built us our synagogue. and jesus went with them. and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say the word and my servant shall be healed. for i also am a man set under authority having under myself soldiers and i say to this one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it. and when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel. and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole.  and it came to pass soon afterwards that he went to a city called nain and his disciples went with him and a great multitude. now when he drew near to the gate of the city behold there was carried out one that was dead the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her. and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not. and he came nigh and touched the bier and the bearers stood still. and he said young man i say unto thee arise. and he that was dead sat up and began to speak. and he gave him to his mother. and fear took hold on all and they glorified god saying a great prophet is arisen among us and god hath visited his people. and this report went forth concerning him in the whole of judaea and all the region round about. and the disciples of john told him of all these things. and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the lord saying art thou he that cometh or look we for another and when the men were come unto him they said john the baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that cometh or look we for another  in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. and he answered and said unto them go and tell john the things which ye have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up the poor have good tidings preached to them. and blessed is he whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. and when the messengers of john were departed he began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to behold a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts. but what went ye out to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet. this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee.  i say unto you among them that are born of women there is none greater than john yet he that is but little in the kingdom of god is greater than he.  and all the people when they heard and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john. but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of god being not baptized of him. whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children that sit in the marketplace and call one to another who say we piped unto you and ye did not dance we wailed and ye did not weep. for john the baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a demon. the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners and wisdom is justified of all her children. and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. and he entered into the pharisees house and sat down to meat.  and behold a woman who was in the city a sinner and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the pharisees house she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment and standing behind at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.  now when the pharisee that had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him that she is a sinner. and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee. and he saith teacher say on. a certain lender had two debtors the one owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty. when they had not [wherewith] to pay he forgave them both. which of them therefore will love him most simon answered and said he i suppose to whom he forgave the most. and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged.  and turning to the woman he said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath wetted my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. thou gavest me no kiss but she since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. my head with oil thou didst not anoint but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven [the same] loveth little. and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven. and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that even forgiveth sins and he said unto the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace. and it came to pass soon afterwards that he went about through cities and villages preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of god and with him the twelve and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary that was called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out  and joanna the wife of chuzas herods steward and susanna and many others who ministered unto them of their substance. and when a great multitude came together and they of every city resorted unto him he spake by a parable the sower went forth to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden under foot and the birds of the heaven devoured it. and other fell on the rock and as soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture. and other fell amidst the thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it. and other fell into the good ground and grew and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. as he said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear. and his disciples asked him what this parable might be. and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand. now the parable is this the seed is the word of god. and those by the way side are they that have heard then cometh the devil and taketh away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved.  and those on the rock [are] they who when they have heard receive the word with joy and these have no root who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away. and that which fell among the thorns these are they that have heard and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life and bring no fruit to perfection. and that in the good ground these are such as in an honest and good heart having heard the word hold it fast and bring forth fruit with patience. and no man when he hath lighted a lamp covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but putteth it on a stand that they that enter in may see the light. for nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest nor [anything] secret that shall not be known and come to light. take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath. and there came to him his mother and brethren and they could not come at him for the crowd. and it was told him thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee.  but he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of god and do it. now it came to pass on one of those days that he entered into a boat himself and his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth. but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filling [with water] and were in jeopardy. and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish. and he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm. and he said unto them where is your faith and being afraid they marvelled saying one to another who then is this that he commandeth even the winds and the water and they obey him and they arrived at the country of the gerasenes which is over against galilee. and when he was come forth upon the land there met him a certain man out of the city who had demons and for a long time he had worn no clothes and abode not in [any] house but in the tombs.  and when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i beseech thee torment me not. for he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. for oftentimes it had seized him and he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters and breaking the bands asunder he was driven of the demon into the deserts. and jesus asked him what is thy name and he said legion for many demons were entered into him. and they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. and he gave them leave. and the demons came out from the man and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake and were drowned. and when they that fed them saw what had come to pass they fled and told it in the city and in the country.  and they went out to see what had come to pass and they came to jesus and found the man from whom the demons were gone out sitting clothed and in his right mind at the feet of jesus and they were afraid. and they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole. and all the people of the country of the gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them for they were holden with great fear and he entered into a boat and returned. but the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him but he sent him away saying return to thy house and declare how great things god hath done for thee. and he went his way publishing throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done for him. and as jesus returned the multitude welcomed him for they were all waiting for him. and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him to come into his house for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying. but as he went the multitudes thronged him.  and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years who had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. and jesus said who is it that touched me and when all denied peter said and they that were with him master the multitudes press thee and crush [thee]. but jesus said some one did touch me for i perceived that power had gone forth from me. and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him and how she was healed immediately. and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace. while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues [house] saying thy daughter is dead trouble not the teacher. but jesus hearing it answered him fear not only believe and she shall be made whole.  and when he came to the house he suffered not any man to enter in with him save peter and john and james and the father of the maiden and her mother. and all were weeping and bewailing her but he said weep not for she is not dead but sleepeth. and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead. but he taking her by the hand called saying maiden arise. and her spirit returned and she rose up immediately and he commanded that [something] be given her to eat. and her parents were amazed but he charged them to tell no man what had been done. and he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases. and he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick. and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staff nor wallet nor bread nor money neither have two coats. and into whatsoever house ye enter there abide and thence depart. and as many as receive you not when ye depart from that city shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.  and they departed and went throughout the villages preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done and he was much perplexed because that it was said by some that john was risen from the dead and by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the old prophets was risen again. and herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things and he sought to see him. and the apostles when they were returned declared unto him what things they had done. and he took them and withdrew apart to a city called bethsaida. but the multitudes perceiving it followed him and he welcomed them and spake to them of the kingdom of god and them that had need of healing he cured. and the day began to wear away and the twelve came and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and country round about and lodge and get provisions for we are here in a desert place.  but he said unto them give ye them to eat. and they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy food for all this people. for they were about five thousand men. and he said unto his disciples make them sit down in companies about fifty each. and they did so and made them all sit down. and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. and they ate and were all filled and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces twelve baskets. and it came to pass as he was praying apart the disciples were with him and he asked them saying who do the multitudes say that i am and they answering said john the baptist but others [say] elijah and others that one of the old prophets is risen again. and he said unto them but who say ye that i am and peter answering said the christ of god. but he charged them and commanded [them] to tell this to no man  saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up. and he said unto all if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. for whosoever would save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it. for what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose or forfeit his own self for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in his own glory and [the glory] of the father and of the holy angels. but i tell you of a truth there are some of them that stand here who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the kingdom of god. and it came to pass about eight days after these sayings that he took with him peter and john and james and went up into the mountain to pray. and as he was praying the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment [became] white [and] dazzling. and behold there talked with him two men who were moses and elijah  who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem. now peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him. and it came to pass as they were parting from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah not knowing what he said. and while he said these things there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud. and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my son my chosen hear ye him. and when the voice came jesus was found alone. and they held their peace and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen. and it came to pass on the next day when they were come down from the mountain a great multitude met him. and behold a man from the multitude cried saying teacher i beseech thee to look upon my son for he is mine only child  and behold a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth and it hardly departeth from him bruising him sorely. and i besought thy disciples to cast it out and they could not. and jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and bear with you bring hither thy son. and as he was yet a coming the demon dashed him down and tare [him] grievously. but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. and they were all astonished at the majesty of god. but while all were marvelling at all the things which he did he said unto his disciples let these words sink into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men. but they understood not this saying and it was concealed from them that they should not perceive it and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. and there arose a reasoning among them which of them was the greatest. but when jesus saw the reasoning of their heart he took a little child and set him by his side  and said unto them whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same is great. and john answered and said master we saw one casting out demons in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not with us. but jesus said unto him forbid [him] not for he that is not against you is for you. and it came to pass when the days were well nigh come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him. and they did not receive him because his face was [as though he were] going to jerusalem. and when his disciples james and john saw [this] they said lord wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven and consume them but he turned and rebuked them. and they went to another village. and as they went on the way a certain man said unto him i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  and jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven [have] nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head. and he said unto another follow me. but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father. but he said unto him leave the dead to bury their own dead but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of god. and another also said i will follow thee lord but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house. but jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god. now after these things the lord appointed seventy others and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself was about to come. and he said unto them the harvest indeed is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers into his harvest. go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. carry no purse no wallet no shoes and salute no man on the way. and into whatsoever house ye shall enter first say peace [be] to this house.  and if a son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon him but if not it shall turn to you again. and in that same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire. go not from house to house. and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you. but into whatsoever city ye shall enter and they receive you not go out into the streets thereof and say even the dust from your city that cleaveth to our feet we wipe off against you nevertheless know this that the kingdom of god is come nigh. i say unto you it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city. woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes. but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the judgment than for you.  and thou capernaum shalt thou be exalted unto heaven thou shalt be brought down unto hades. he that heareth you heareth me and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me. and the seventy returned with joy saying lord even the demons are subject unto us in thy name. and he said unto them i beheld satan fallen as lightning from heaven. behold i have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.  nevertheless in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. in that same hour he rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding and didst reveal them unto babes yea father for so it was well pleasing in thy sight. all things have been delivered unto me of my father and no one knoweth who the son is save the father and who the father is save the son and he to whomsoever the son willeth to reveal [him].  and turning to the disciples he said privately blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see for i say unto you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see and saw them not and to hear the things which ye hear and heard them not. and behold a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him saying teacher what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself.  and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live. but he desiring to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor jesus made answer and said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead. and by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.  and in like manner a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side. but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with compassion and came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on [them] oil and wine and he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. and on the morrow he took out two shillings and gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more i when i come back again will repay thee. which of these three thinkest thou proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers  and he said he that showed mercy on him. and jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise. now as they went on their way he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house. and she had a sister called mary who also sat at the lords feet and heard his word. but martha was cumbered about much serving and she came up to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me.  but the lord answered and said unto her martha martha thou art anxious and troubled about many things but one thing is needful for mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her. and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place that when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray even as john also taught his disciples. and he said unto them when ye pray say father hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come. give us day by day our daily bread. and forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. and bring us not into temptation. and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee  i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth. and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you. for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. and of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf and he give him a stone or a fish and he for a fish give him a serpent or [if] he shall ask an egg will he give him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall [your] heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him and he was casting out a demon [that was] dumb. and it came to pass when the demon was gone out the dumb man spake and the multitudes marvelled. but some of them said by beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons. and others trying [him] sought of him a sign from heaven.  but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house [divided] against a house falleth. and if satan also is divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out demons by beelzebub. and if i by beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges. but if i by the finger of god cast out demons then is the kingdom of god come upon you. when the strong [man] fully armed guardeth his own court his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils. he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passeth through waterless places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will turn back unto my house whence i came out. and when he is come he findeth it swept and garnished.  then goeth he and taketh [to him] seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. and it came to pass as he said these things a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the breasts which thou didst suck. but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it. and when the multitudes were gathering together unto him he began to say this generation is an evil generation it seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of jonah. for even as jonah became a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation. the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here.  the men of nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and behold a greater than jonah is here. no man when he hath lighted a lamp putteth it in a cellar neither under the bushel but on the stand that they which enter in may see the light. the lamp of thy body is thine eye when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when it is evil thy body also is full of darkness. look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness. if therefore thy whole body be full of light having no part dark it shall be wholly full of light as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light. now as he spake a pharisee asketh him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat. and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner. and the lord said unto him now ye the pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. ye foolish ones did not he that made the outside make the inside also  but give for alms those things which are within and behold all things are clean unto you. but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb and pass over justice and the love of god but these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone. woe unto you pharisees for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues and the salutations in the marketplaces. woe unto you for ye are as the tombs which appear not and the men that walk over [them] know it not. and one of the lawyers answering saith unto him teacher in saying this thou reproachest us also. and he said woe unto you lawyers also for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. woe unto you for ye build the tombs of the prophets and your fathers killed them. so ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers for they killed them and ye build [their tombs]. therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send unto them prophets and apostles and [some] of them they shall kill and persecute  that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation from the blood of abel unto the blood of zachariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary yea i say unto you it shall be required of this generation. woe unto you lawyers for ye took away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered. and when he was come out from thence the scribes and the pharisees began to press upon [him] vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things laying wait for him to catch something out of his mouth. in the mean time when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together insomuch that they trod one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy. but there is nothing covered up that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known. wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.  and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do. but i will warn you whom ye shall fear fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him. are not five sparrows sold for two pence and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of god. but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. fear not ye are of more value than many sparrows. and i say unto you every one who shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of god. and every one who shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven. and when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities be not anxious how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say for the holy spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.  and one out of the multitude said unto him teacher bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. but he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you and he said unto them take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he reasoned within himself saying what shall i do because i have not where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my grain and my goods. and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink be merry. but god said unto him thou foolish one this night is thy soul required of thee and the things which thou hast prepared whose shall they be so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god. and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you be not anxious for [your] life what ye shall eat nor yet for your body what ye shall put on.  for the life is more than the food and the body than the raiment. consider the ravens that they sow not neither reap which have no storechamber nor barn and god feedeth them of how much more value are ye than the birds and which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life if then ye are not able to do even that which is least why are ye anxious concerning the rest consider the lilies how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet i say unto you even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. but if god doth so clothe the grass in the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more [shall he clothe] you o ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind. for all these things do the nations of the world seek after but your father knoweth that ye have need of these things. yet seek ye his kingdom and these things shall be added unto you. fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  sell that which ye have and give alms make for yourselves purses which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief draweth near neither moth destroyeth. for where your treasure is there will your heart be also. let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord when he shall return from the marriage feast that when he cometh and knocketh they may straightway open unto him. blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them sit down to meat and shall come and serve them. and if he shall come in the second watch and if in the third and find [them] so blessed are those [servants]. but know this that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched and not have left his house to be broken through. be ye also ready for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh. and peter said lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even unto all  and the lord said who then is the faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall set over his household to give them their portion of food in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. of a truth i say unto you that he will set him over all that he hath. but if that servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not and in an hour when he knoweth not and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the unfaithful. and that servant who knew his lords will and made not ready nor did according to his will shall be beaten with many [stripes] but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few [stripes]. and to whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom they commit much of him will they ask the more. i came to cast fire upon the earth and what do i desire if it is already kindled but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished  think ye that i am come to give peace in the earth i tell you nay but rather division for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided three against two and two against three. they shall be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against her mother mother in law against her daughter in law and daughter in law against her mother in law. and he said to the multitudes also when ye see a cloud rising in the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it cometh to pass. and when [ye see] a south wind blowing ye say there will be a scorching heat and it cometh to pass. ye hypocrites ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right for as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate on the way give diligence to be quit of him lest haply he drag thee unto the judge and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer and the officer shall cast thee into prison.  i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou have paid the very last mite. now there were some present at that very season who told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. and he answered and said unto them think ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they have suffered these things i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all in like manner perish. or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in jerusalem i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish. and he spake this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit thereon and found none. and he said unto the vinedresser behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why doth it also cumber the ground and he answering saith unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit thenceforth [well] but if not thou shalt cut it down.  and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day. and behold a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and she was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up. and when jesus saw her he called her and said to her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity. and he laid his hands upon her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god. and the ruler of the synagogue being moved with indignation because jesus had healed on the sabbath answered and said to the multitude there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the day of the sabbath. but the lord answered him and said ye hypocrites doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan had bound lo [these] eighteen years to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath and as he said these things all his adversaries were put to shame and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.  he said therefore unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i liken it it is like unto a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his own garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof. and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god it is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened. and he went on his way through cities and villages teaching and journeying on unto jerusalem. and one said unto him lord are they few that are saved and he said unto them strive to enter in by the narrow door for many i say unto you shall seek to enter in and shall not be able. when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord open to us and he shall answer and say to you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we did eat and drink in thy presence and thou didst teach in our streets  and he shall say i tell you i know not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and yourselves cast forth without. and they shall come from the east and west and from the north and south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god. and behold there are last who shall be first and there are first who shall be last. in that very hour there came certain pharisees saying to him get thee out and go hence for herod would fain kill thee. and he said unto them go and say to that fox behold i cast out demons and perform cures to day and to morrow and the third [day] i am perfected.  nevertheless i must go on my way today and tomorrow and the [day] following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem. o jerusalem jerusalem that killeth the prophets and stoneth them that are sent unto her how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen [gathereth] her own brood under her wings and ye would not  behold your house is left unto you [desolate] and i say unto you ye shall not see me until ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord. and it came to pass when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread that they were watching him. and behold there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy. and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not but they held their peace. and he took him and healed him and let him go. and he said unto them which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day and they could not answer again unto these things. and he spake a parable unto those that were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief seats saying unto them  when thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast sit not down in the chief seat lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee give this man place and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.  but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest place that when he that hath bidden thee cometh he may say to thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee. for everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. and he said to him also that had bidden him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor rich neighbors lest haply they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee. but when thou makest a feast bid the poor the maimed the lame the blind and thou shalt be blessed because they have not [wherewith] to recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just. and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god.  but he said unto him a certain man made a great supper and he bade many and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for [all] things are now ready.  and they all with one [consent] began to make excuse. the first said unto him i have bought a field and i must needs go out and see it i pray thee have me excused. and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused. and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come. and the servant came and told his lord these things. then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. and the servant said lord what thou didst command is done and yet there is room. and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and constrain [them] to come in that my house may be filled. for i say unto you that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper. now there went with him great multitudes and he turned and said unto them if any man cometh unto me and hateth not his own father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple.  whosoever doth not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. for which of you desiring to build a tower doth not first sit down and count the cost whether he have [wherewith] to complete it lest haply when he hath laid a foundation and is not able to finish all that behold begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish. or what king as he goeth to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and asketh conditions of peace. so therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple. salt therefore is good but if even the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill [men] cast it out. he that hath ears to hear let him hear. now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.  and both the pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them. and he spake unto them this parable saying what man of you having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing. and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and his neighbors saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost. i say unto you that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth [more] than over ninety and nine righteous persons who need no repentance. or what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it and when she hath found it she calleth together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost. even so i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth.  and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of [thy] substance that falleth to me. and he divided unto them his living. and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that country and he began to be in want. and he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him. but when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish here with hunger i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight i am no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of thy hired servants.  and he arose and came to his father. but while he was yet afar off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight i am no more worthy to be called thy son. but the father said to his servants bring forth quickly the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the fatted calf [and] kill it and let us eat and make merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found. and they began to be merry. now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing. and he called to him one of the servants and inquired what these things might be. and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound. but he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and entreated him.  but he answered and said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee and i never transgressed a commandment of thine and [yet] thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends but when this thy son came who hath devoured thy living with harlots thou killedst for him the fatted calf. and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that is mine is thine. but it was meet to make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive [again] and [was] lost and is found. and he said also unto the disciples there was a certain rich man who had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. and he called him and said unto him what is this that i hear of thee render the account of thy stewardship for thou canst be no longer steward. and the steward said within himself what shall i do seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me i have not strength to dig to beg i am ashamed. i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses.  and calling to him each one of his lords debtors he said to the first how much owest thou unto my lord and he said a hundred measures of oil. and he said unto him take thy bond and sit down quickly and write fifty. then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said a hundred measures of wheat. he saith unto him take thy bond and write fourscore. and his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. and i say unto you make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness that when it shall fail they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. he that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true [riches] and if ye have not been faithful in that which is anothers who will give you that which is your own  no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other. ye cannot serve god and mammon. and the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all these things and they scoffed at him. and he said unto them ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of god. the law and the prophets [were] until john from that time the gospel of the kingdom of god is preached and every man entereth violently into it. but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fall. every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery. now there was a certain rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen faring sumptuously every day and a certain beggar named lazarus was laid at his gate full of sores and desiring to be fed with the [crumbs] that fell from the rich mans table yea even the dogs come and licked his sores.  and it came to pass that the beggar died and that he was carried away by the angels into abrahams bosom and the rich man also died and was buried. and in hades he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom. and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in anguish in this flame. but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish. and besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able and that none may cross over from thence to us. and he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment. but abraham saith they have moses and the prophets let them hear them.  and he said nay father abraham but if one go to them from the dead they will repent. and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rise from the dead. and he said unto his disciples it is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come but woe unto him through whom they come it were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were thrown into the sea rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. take heed to yourselves if thy brother sin rebuke him and if he repent forgive him. and if he sin against thee seven times in the day and seven times turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him. and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith. and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye would say unto this sycamine tree be thou rooted up and be thou planted in the sea and it would obey you. but who is there of you having a servant plowing or keeping sheep that will say unto him when he is come in from the field come straightway and sit down to meat  and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded even so ye also when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which it was our duty to do. and it came to pass as they were on their way to jerusalem that he was passing along the borders of samaria and galilee. and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers who stood afar off and they lifted up their voices saying jesus master have mercy on us. and when he saw them he said unto them go and show yourselves unto the priests. and it came to pass as they went they were cleansed. and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back with a loud voice glorifying god and he fell upon his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan. and jesus answering said were not the ten cleansed but where are the nine  were there none found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise and go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole. and being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god cometh he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or there for lo the kingdom of god is within you. and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it. and they shall say to you lo there lo here go not away nor follow after [them] for as the lightning when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall the son of man be in his day. but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation. and as it came to pass in the days of noah even so shall it be also in the days of the son of man. they ate they drank they married they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.  likewise even as it came to pass in the days of lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but in the day that lot went out from sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all after the same manner shall it be in the day that the son of man is revealed. in that day he that shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house let him not go down to take them away and let him that is in the field likewise not return back. remember lots wife. whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose [his life] shall preserve it. i say unto you in that night there shall be two men on one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left. there shall be two women grinding together the one shall be taken and the other shall be left. [there shall be two men in the field the one shall be taken and the other shall be left.] and they answering say unto him where lord and he said unto them where the body [is] thither will the eagles also be gathered together. and he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray and not to faint  saying there was in a city a judge who feared not god and regarded not man and there was a widow in that city and she came oft unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary. and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest she wear me out by her continual coming. and the lord said hear what the unrighteous judge saith. and shall not god avenge his elect that cry to him day and night and [yet] he is longsuffering over them i say unto you that he will avenge them speedily. nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and set all others at nought two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican. the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as the rest of men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican. i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i get.  but the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote his breast saying god be thou merciful to me a sinner. i say unto you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. and they were bringing unto him also their babes that he should touch them but when the disciples saw it they rebuked them. but jesus called them unto him saying suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for to such belongeth the kingdom of god. verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall in no wise enter therein. and a certain ruler asked him saying good teacher what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one [even] god. thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and mother. and he said all these things have i observed from my youth up.  and when jesus heard it he said unto him one thing thou lackest yet sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me. but when he heard these things he became exceeding sorrowful for he was very rich. and jesus seeing him said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god. and they that heard it said then who can be saved but he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god. and peter said lo we have left our own and followed thee. and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or wife or brethren or parents or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this time and in the world to come eternal life. and he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the son of man.  for he shall be delivered up unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon and they shall scourge and kill him and the third day he shall rise again. and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them and they perceived not the things that were said. and it came to pass as he drew nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing a multitude going by he inquired what this meant. and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by. and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me. and they that went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me. and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him  what wilt thou that i should do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight. and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath made thee whole.  and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god. and he entered and was passing through jericho. and behold a man called by name zacchaeus and he was a chief publican and he was rich. and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the crowd because he was little of stature. and he ran on before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way. and when jesus came to the place he looked up and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house. and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully. and when they saw it they all murmured saying he is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have wrongfully exacted aught of any man i restore fourfold. and jesus said unto him today is salvation come to this house forasmuch as he also is a son of abraham.  for the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and [because] they supposed that the kingdom of god was immediately to appear. he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. and he called ten servants of his and gave them ten pounds and said unto them trade ye [herewith] till i come. but his citizens hated him and sent an ambassage after him saying we will not that this man reign over us. and it came to pass when he was come back again having received the kingdom that he commanded these servants unto whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by trading. and the first came before him saying lord thy pound hath made ten pounds more. and he said unto him well done thou good servant because thou wast found faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities.  and the second came saying thy pound lord hath made five pounds. and he said unto him also be thou also over five cities. and another came saying lord behold [here is] thy pound which i kept laid up in a napkin for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that which thou layedst not down and reapest that which thou didst not sow. he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant. thou knewest that i am an austere man taking up that which i laid not down and reaping that which i did not sow then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank and i at my coming should have required it with interest and he said unto them that stood by take away from him the pound and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds. i say unto you that unto every one that hath shall be given but from him that hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away from him. but these mine enemies that would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me.  and when he had thus spoken he went on before going up to jerusalem. and it came to pass when he drew nigh unto bethphage and bethany at the mount that is called olivet he sent two of the disciples saying go your way into the village over against [you] in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat loose him and bring him. and if any one ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say the lord hath need of him. and they that were sent went away and found even as he had said unto them. and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt and they said the lord hath need of him. and they brought him to jesus and they threw their garments upon the colt and set jesus thereon. and as he went they spread their garments in the way. and as he was now drawing nigh [even] at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen saying blessed [is] the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest.  and some of the pharisees from the multitude said unto him teacher rebuke thy disciples. and he answered and said i tell you that if these shall hold their peace the stones will cry out. and when he drew nigh he saw the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known in this day even thou the things which belong unto peace but now they are hid from thine eyes. for the days shall come upon thee when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. and he entered into the temple and began to cast out them that sold saying unto them it is written and my house shall be a house of prayer but ye have made it a den of robbers. and he was teaching daily in the temple. but the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him and they could not find what they might do for the people all hung upon him listening.  and it came to pass on one of the days as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders and they spake saying unto him tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority and he answered and said unto them i also will ask you a question and tell me the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why did ye not believe him but if we shall say from men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that john was a prophet. and they answered that they knew not whence [it was]. and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things. and he began to speak unto the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country for a long time. and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.  and he sent yet another servant and him also they beat and handled him shamefully and sent him away empty. and he sent yet a third and him also they wounded and cast him forth. and the lord of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him. but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned one with another saying this is the heir let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours. and they cast him forth out of the vineyard and killed him. what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them he will come and destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others. and when they heard it they said god forbid. but he looked upon them and said what then is this that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will scatter him as dust. and the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour and they feared the people for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.  and they watched him and sent forth spies who feigned themselves to be righteous that they might take hold of his speech so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor. and they asked him saying teacher we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly and acceptest not the person [of any] but of a truth teachest the way of god is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or not but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them show me a denarius. whose image and superscription hath it and they said caesars. and he said unto them then render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods. and they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace. and there came to him certain of the sadducees they that say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying teacher moses wrote unto us that if a mans brother die having a wife and he be childless his brother should take the wife and raise up seed unto his brother.  there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died childless and the second and the third took her and likewise the seven also left no children and died. afterward the woman also died. in the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be for the seven had her to wife. and jesus said unto them the sons of this world marry and are given in marriage but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage for neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are sons of god being sons of the resurrection. but that the dead are raised even moses showed in [the place concerning] the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob. now he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him. and certain of the scribes answering said teacher thou hast well said. for they durst not any more ask him any question. and he said unto them how say they that the christ is davids son  for david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. david therefore calleth him lord and how is he his son and in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love salutations in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts who devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater condemnation. and he looked up and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury. and he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. and he said of a truth i say unto you this poor widow cast in more than they all for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had. and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings he said as for these things which ye behold the days will come in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.  and they asked him saying teacher when therefore shall these things be and what [shall be] the sign when these things are about to come to pass and he said take heed that ye be not led astray for many shall come in my name saying i am [he] and the time is at hand go ye not after them. and when ye shall hear of wars and tumults be not terrified for these things must needs come to pass first but the end is not immediately. then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be great earthquakes and in divers places famines and pestilences and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven. but before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and shall persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake. it shall turn out unto you for a testimony. settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay.  but ye shall be delivered up even by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death. and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake. and not a hair of your head shall perish. in your patience ye shall win your souls. but when ye see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that her desolation is at hand. then let them that are in judaea flee unto the mountains and let them that are in the midst of her depart out and let not them that are in the country enter therein. for these are days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled. woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress upon the land and wrath unto this people. and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led captive into all the nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled. and there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows  men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. but when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up your heads because your redemption draweth nigh. and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh. even so ye also when ye see these things coming to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh. verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all things be accomplished. heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away. but take heed to yourselves lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and that day come on you suddenly as a snare for [so] shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.  but watch ye at every season making supplication that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man. and every day he was teaching in the temple and every night he went out and lodged in the mount that is called olivet. and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him. now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover. and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death for they feared the people. and satan entered into judas who was called iscariot being of the number of the twelve. and he went away and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might deliver him unto them. and they were glad and covenanted to give him money. and he consented and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude. and the day of unleavened bread came on which the passover must be sacrificed. and he sent peter and john saying go and make ready for us the passover that we may eat.  and they said unto him where wilt thou that we make ready and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. and ye shall say unto the master of the house the teacher saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished there make ready. and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover. and when the hour was come he sat down and the apostles with him. and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i shall not eat it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god. and he received a cup and when he had given thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves for i say unto you i shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come. and he took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and gave to them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me.  and the cup in like manner after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood [even] that which is poured out for you. but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. for the son of man indeed goeth as it hath been determined but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed and they began to question among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing. and there arose also a contention among them which of them was accounted to be greatest. and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles have lordship over them and they that have authority over them are called benefactors. but ye [shall] not [be] so but he that is the greater among you let him become as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve. for which is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am in the midst of you as he that serveth. but ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations and i appoint unto you a kingdom even as my father appointed unto me  that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel. simon simon behold satan asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat but i made supplication for thee that thy faith fail not and do thou when once thou hast turned again establish thy brethren. and he said unto him lord with thee i am ready to go both to prison and to death. and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. and he said unto them when i sent you forth without purse and wallet and shoes lacked ye anything and they said nothing. and he said unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise a wallet and he that hath none let him sell his cloak and buy a sword.  for i say unto you that this which is written must be fulfilled in me and he was reckoned with transgressors for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment. and they said lord behold here are two swords. and he said unto them it is enough.  and he came out and went as his custom was unto the mount of olives and the disciples also followed him. and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation. and he was parted from them about a stones cast and he kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done. and there appeared unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him. and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. and when he rose up from his prayer he came unto the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray that ye enter not into temptation.  while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and he drew near unto jesus to kiss him. but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss and when they that were about him saw what would follow they said lord shall we smite with the sword  and a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his right ear. but jesus answered and said suffer ye [them] thus far. and he touched his ear and healed him. and jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders that were come against him are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched not forth your hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness. and they seized him and led him [away] and brought him into the high priests house. but peter followed afar off. and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court and had sat down together peter sat in the midst of them. and a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light [of the fire] and looking stedfastly upon him said this man also was with him.  but he denied saying woman i know him not. and after a little while another saw him and said thou also art [one] of them. but peter said man i am not. and after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this man also was with him for he is a galilaean.  but peter said man i know not what thou sayest. and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew. and the lord turned and looked upon peter. and peter remembered the word of the lord how that he said unto him before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice. and he went out and wept bitterly. and the men that held [jesus] mocked him and beat him. and they blindfolded him and asked him saying prophesy who is he that struck thee and many other things spake they against him reviling him. and as soon as it was day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together both chief priests and scribes and they led him away into their council saying if thou art the christ tell us. but he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i ask [you] ye will not answer. but from henceforth shall the son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of god. and they all said art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am. and they said what further need have we of witness for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.  and the whole company of them rose up and brought him before pilate. and they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar and saying that he himself is christ a king. and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest. and pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes i find no fault in this man. but they were the more urgent saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all judaea and beginning from galilee even unto this place. but when pilate heard it he asked whether the man were a galilaean. and when he knew that he was of herods jurisdiction he sent him unto herod who himself also was at jerusalem in these days. now when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was of a long time desirous to see him because he had heard concerning him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. and he questioned him in many words but he answered him nothing. and the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him.  and herod with his soldiers set him at nought and mocked him and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to pilate. and herod and pilate became friends with each other that very day for before they were at enmity between themselves. and pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people and said unto them ye brought unto me this man as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for he sent him back unto us and behold nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. i will therefore chastise him and release him. [now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.] but they cried out all together saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas  one who for a certain insurrection made in the city and for murder was cast into prison. and pilate spake unto them again desiring to release jesus but they shouted saying crucify crucify him.  and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath this man done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and release him. but they were urgent with loud voices asking that he might be crucified. and their voices prevailed. and pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done. and he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison whom they asked for but jesus he delivered up to their will. and when they led him away they laid hold upon one simon of cyrene coming from the country and laid on him the cross to bear it after jesus. and there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who bewailed and lamented him. but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children. for behold the days are coming in which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the breasts that never gave suck. then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us. for if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry  and there were also two others malefactors led with him to be put to death. and when they came unto the place which is called the skull there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left. and jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do. and parting his garments among them they cast lots. and the people stood beholding. and the rulers also scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if this is the christ of god his chosen. and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him offering him vinegar and saying if thou art the king of the jews save thyself. and there was also a superscription over him this is the king of the jews. and one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him saying art not thou the christ save thyself and us. but the other answered and rebuking him said dost thou not even fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss. and he said jesus remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.  and he said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise. and it was now about the sixth hour and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour the suns light failing and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. and jesus crying with a loud voice said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said this he gave up the ghost. and when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man. and all the multitudes that came together to this sight when they beheld the things that were done returned smiting their breasts. and all his acquaintance and the women that followed with him from galilee stood afar off seeing these things. and behold a man named joseph who was a councillor a good and righteous man he had not consented to their counsel and deed [a man] of arimathaea a city of the jews who was looking for the kingdom of god this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus. and he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone where never man had yet lain.  and it was the day of the preparation and the sabbath drew on. and the women who had come with him out of galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how his body was laid. and they returned and prepared spices and ointments. and on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment. but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came unto the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus. and it came to pass while they were perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in dazzling apparel and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again. and they remembered his words and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.  now they were mary magdalene and joanna and mary the [mother] of james and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles. and these words appeared in their sight as idle talk and they disbelieved them. but peter arose and ran unto the tomb and stooping and looking in he seeth the linen cloths by themselves and he departed to his home wondering at that which was come to pass. and behold two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus which was threescore furlongs from jerusalem. and they communed with each other of all these things which had happened. and it came to pass while they communed and questioned together that jesus himself drew near and went with them. but their eyes were holden that they should not know him. and he said unto them what communications are these that ye have one with another as ye walk and they stood still looking sad. and one of them named cleopas answering said unto him dost thou alone sojourn in jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days  and he said unto them what things and they said unto him the things concerning jesus the nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him. but we hoped that it was he who should redeem israel. yea and besides all this it is now the third day since these things came to pass. moreover certain women of our company amazed us having been early at the tomb and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. and certain of them that were with us went to the tomb and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not. and he said unto them o foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken behooved it not the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory and beginning from moses and from all the prophets he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.  and they drew nigh unto the village whither they were going and he made as though he would go further. and they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent. and he went in to abide with them. and it came to pass when he had sat down with them to meat he took the bread and blessed and breaking [it] he gave to them. and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight. and they said one to another was not our heart burning within us while he spake to us in the way while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up that very hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon. and they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread. and as they spake these things he himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace [be] unto you. but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they beheld a spirit.  and he said unto them why are ye troubled and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart see my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye behold me having. and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet. and while they still disbelieved for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here anything to eat and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish. and he took it and ate before them. and he said unto them these are my words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms concerning me. then opened he their mind that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations beginning from jerusalem. ye are witnesses of these things.  and behold i send forth the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city until ye be clothed with power from on high. and he led them out until [they were] over against bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. and it came to pass while he blessed them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple blessing god. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god. the same was in the beginning with god. all things were made through him and without him was not anything made that hath been made. in him was life and the life was the light of men. and the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness apprehended it not. there came a man sent from god whose name was john. the same came for witness that he might bear witness of the light that all might believe through him. he was not the light but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.  there was the true light [even the light] which lighteth every man coming into the world. he was in the world and the world was made through him and the world knew him not. he came unto his own and they that were his own received him not. but as many as received him to them gave he the right to become children of god [even] to them that believe on his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god. and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten from the father full of grace and truth. john beareth witness of him and crieth saying this was he of whom i said he that cometh after me is become before me for he was before me. for of his fulness we all received and grace for grace. for the law was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ. no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath declared [him]. and this is the witness of john when the jews sent unto him from jerusalem priests and levites to ask him who art thou  and he confessed and denied not and he confessed i am not the christ. and they asked him what then art thou elijah and he saith i am not. art thou the prophet and he answered no. they said therefore unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us. what sayest thou of thyself he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said isaiah the prophet. and they had been sent from the pharisees. and they asked him and said unto him why then baptizest thou if thou art not the christ neither elijah neither the prophet john answered them saying i baptize in water in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not [even] he that cometh after me the latchet of whose shoe i am not worthy to unloose. these things were done in bethany beyond the jordan where john was baptizing. on the morrow he seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man who is become before me for he was before me.  and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel for this cause came i baptizing in water. and john bare witness saying i have beheld the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven and it abode upon him. and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize in water he said unto me upon whomsoever thou shalt see the spirit descending and abiding upon him the same is he that baptizeth in the holy spirit. and i have seen and have borne witness that this is the son of god. again on the morrow john was standing and two of his disciples and he looked upon jesus as he walked and saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus. and jesus turned and beheld them following and saith unto them what seek ye and they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted teacher where abideth thou he saith unto them come and ye shall see. they came therefore and saw where he abode and they abode with him that day it was about the tenth hour. one of the two that heard john [speak] and followed him was andrew simon peters brother.  he findeth first his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messiah which is being interpreted christ. he brought him unto jesus. jesus looked upon him and said thou art simon the son of john thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation peter. on the morrow he was minded to go forth into galilee and he findeth philip and jesus saith unto him follow me. now philip was from bethsaida of the city of andrew and peter. philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets wrote jesus of nazareth the son of joseph. and nathanael said unto him can any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see. jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee. nathanael answered him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art king of israel.  jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee underneath the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these. and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you ye shall see the heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man. and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there  and jesus also was bidden and his disciples to the marriage. and when the wine failed the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine. and jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come. his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it. now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the jews manner of purifying containing two or three firkins apiece. jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water. and they filled them up to the brim. and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the ruler of the feast. and they bare it.  and when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine and knew not whence it was but the servants that had drawn the water knew the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom and saith unto him every man setteth on first the good wine and when [men] have drunk freely [then] that which is worse thou hast kept the good wine until now. this beginning of his signs did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed on him.  after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and [his] brethren and his disciples and there they abode not many days. and the passover of the jews was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem. and he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and he made a scourge of cords and cast all out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen and he poured out the changers money and overthrew their tables and to them that sold the doves he said take these things hence make not my fathers house a house of merchandise. his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for thy house shall eat me up.  the jews therefore answered and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up. the jews therefore said forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou raise it up in three days but he spake of the temple of his body. when therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spake this and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said.  now when he was in jerusalem at the passover during the feast many believed on his name beholding his signs which he did. but jesus did not trust himself unto them for that he knew all men and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man for he himself knew what was in man. now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came unto him by night and said to him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no one can do these signs that thou doest except god be with him.  jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of god. nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except one be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born anew. the wind bloweth where it will and thou hearest the voice thereof but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit. nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou the teacher of israel and understandest not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that which we know and bear witness of that which we have seen and ye receive not our witness. if i told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you heavenly things  and no one hath ascended into heaven but he that descended out of heaven [even] the son of man who is in heaven. and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life. for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have eternal life. for god sent not the son into the world to judge the world but that the world should be saved through him. he that believeth on him is not judged he that believeth not hath been judged already because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten son of god. and this is the judgment that the light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil. for every one that doeth evil hateth the light and cometh not to the light lest his works should be reproved. but he that doeth the truth cometh to the light that his works may be made manifest that they have been wrought in god.  after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judea and there he tarried with them and baptized. and john also was baptizing in enon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized. for john was not yet cast into prison. there arose therefore a questioning on the part of johns disciples with a jew about purifying. and they came unto john and said to him rabbi he that was with thee beyond the jordan to whom thou hast borne witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him. john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it have been given him from heaven. ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him. he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom that standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is made full. he must increase but i must decrease. he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is of the earth and of the earth he speaketh he that cometh from heaven is above all.  what he hath seen and heard of that he beareth witness and no man receiveth his witness. he that hath received his witness hath set his seal to [this] that god is true. for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for he giveth not the spirit by measure. the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand. he that believeth on the son hath eternal life but he that obeyeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him. when therefore the lord knew that the pharisees had heard that jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than john although jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judea and departed again into galilee. and he must needs pass through samaria. so he cometh to a city of samaria called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph and jacobs well was there. jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus by the well. it was about the sixth hour. there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink. for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.  the samaritan woman therefore saith unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me who am a samaritan woman for jews have no dealings with samaritans. jesus answered and said unto unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water. the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his sons and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come all the way hither to draw. jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither.  the woman answered and said unto him i have no husband. jesus saith unto her thou saidst well i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband this hast thou said truly. the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet. our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when neither in this mountain nor in jerusalem shall ye worship the father. ye worship that which ye know not we worship that which we know for salvation is from the jews. but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and truth for such doth the father seek to be his worshippers. god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth. the woman saith unto him i know that messiah cometh he that is called christ when he is come he will declare unto us all things. jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am [he].  and upon this came his disciples and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why speakest thou with her so the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city and saith to the people come see a man who told me all things that [ever] i did can this be the christ they went out of the city and were coming to him. in the mean while the disciples prayed him saying rabbi eat. but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not. the disciples therefore said one to another hath any man brought him [aught] to eat jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to accomplish his work. say not ye there are yet four months and [then] cometh the harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields that they are white already unto harvest. he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. for herein is the saying true one soweth and another reapeth.  i sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored others have labored and ye are entered into their labor. and from that city many of the samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman who testified he told me all things that [ever] i did. so when the samaritans came unto him they besought him to abide with them and he abode there two days. and many more believed because of his word and they said to the woman now we believe not because of thy speaking for we have heard for ourselves and know that this is indeed the saviour of the world. and after the two days he went forth from thence into galilee. for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. so when he came into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did in jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast. he came therefore again unto cana of galilee where he made the water wine. and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum.  when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought [him] that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death. jesus therefore said unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will in no wise believe. the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die. jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth. the man believed the word that jesus spake unto him and he went his way. and as he was now going down his servants met him saying that his son lived. so he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. they said therefore unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. so the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house. this is again the second sign that jesus did having come out of judaea into galilee. after these things there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem. now there is in jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool which is called in hebrew bethesda having five porches.  in these lay a multitude of them that were sick blind halt withered [waiting for the moving of the water.] [for an angel of the lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole with whatsoever disease he was holden.] and a certain man was there who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. when jesus saw him lying and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case] he saith unto him wouldest thou be made whole the sick man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me. jesus saith unto him arise take up thy bed and walk. and straightway the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. now it was the sabbath on that day. so the jews said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. but he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk.  they asked him who is the man that said unto thee take up [thy bed] and walk but he that was healed knew not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in the place. afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing befall thee. the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him whole. and for this cause the jews persecuted jesus because he did these things on the sabbath. but jesus answered them my father worketh even until now and i work. for this cause therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only brake the sabbath but also called god his own father making himself equal with god. jesus therefore answered and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father doing for what things soever he doeth these the son also doeth in like manner.  for the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and greater works than these will he show him that ye may marvel. for as the father raiseth the dead and giveth them life even so the son also giveth life to whom he will. for neither doth the father judge any man but he hath given all judgment unto the son that all may honor the son even as they honor the father. he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father that sent him. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth him that sent me hath eternal life and cometh not into judgment but hath passed out of death into life. verily verily i say unto you the hour cometh and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live. for as the father hath life in himself even so gave he to the son also to have life in himself and he gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man. marvel not at this for the hour cometh in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice  and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment. i can of myself do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is righteous because i seek not mine own will but the will of him that sent me. if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true. it is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. ye have sent unto john and he hath borne witness unto the truth. but the witness which i receive is not from man howbeit i say these things that ye may be saved. he was the lamp that burneth and shineth and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. but the witness which i have is greater than [that of] john for the works which the father hath given me to accomplish the very works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me. and the father that sent me he hath borne witness of me. ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form. and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he sent him ye believe not.  ye search the scriptures because ye think that in them ye have eternal life and these are they which bear witness of me and ye will not come to me that ye may have life. i receive not glory from men. but i know you that ye have not the love of god in yourselves. i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive. how can ye believe who receive glory one of another and the glory that [cometh] from the only god ye seek not think not that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you [even] moses on whom ye have set your hope. for if ye believed moses ye would believe me for he wrote of me. but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee which is [the sea] of tiberias. and a great multitude followed him because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick. and jesus went up into the mountain and there he sat with his disciples. now the passover the feast of the jews was at hand.  jesus therefore lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him saith unto philip whence are we to buy bread that these may eat and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do. philip answered him two hundred shillings worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one may take a little. one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him there is a lad here who hath five barley loaves and two fishes but what are these among so many jesus said make the people sit down. now there was much grass in the place. so the men sat down in number about five thousand. jesus therefore took the loaves and having given thanks he distributed to them that were set down likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. and when they were filled he saith unto his disciples gather up the broken pieces which remain over that nothing be lost. so they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which remained over unto them that had eaten.  when therefore the people saw the sign which he did they said this is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world. jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king withdrew again into the mountain himself alone. and when evening came his disciples went down unto the sea and they entered into a boat and were going over the sea unto capernaum. and it was now dark and jesus had not yet come to them. and the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. when therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they behold jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the boat and they were afraid. but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid. they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going. on the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there save one and that jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat but [that] his disciples went away alone  howbeit there came boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the lord had given thanks when the multitude therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they themselves got into the boats and came to capernaum seeking jesus. and when they found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw signs but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled. work not for the food which perisheth but for the food which abideth unto eternal life which the son of man shall give unto you for him the father even god hath sealed. they said therefore unto him what must we do that we may work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  they said therefore unto him what then doest thou for a sign that we may see and believe thee what workest thou our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread out of heaven to eat.  jesus therefore said unto them verily verily i say unto you it was not moses that gave you the bread out of heaven but my father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. for the bread of god is that which cometh down out of heaven and giveth life unto the world. they said therefore unto him lord evermore give us this bread. jesus said unto them. i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall not hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. but i said unto you that ye have seen me and yet believe not. all that which the father giveth me shall come unto me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out. for i am come down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me. and this is the will of him that sent me that of all that which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day. for this is the will of my father that every one that beholdeth the son and believeth on him should have eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day.  the jews therefore murmured concerning him because he said i am the bread which came down out of heaven.  and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how doth he now say i am come down out of heaven jesus answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves. no man can come to me except the father that sent me draw him and i will raise him up in the last day. it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of god. every one that hath heard from the father and hath learned cometh unto me. not that any man hath seen the father save he that is from god he hath seen the father. verily verily i say unto you he that believeth hath eternal life. i am the bread of life. your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. this is the bread which cometh down out of heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. i am the living bread which came down out of heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever yea and the bread which i will give is my flesh for the life of the world.  the jews therefore strove one with another saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat  jesus therefore said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have not life in yourselves. he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day. for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed. he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and i in him. as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so he that eateth me he also shall live because of me. this is the bread which came down out of heaven not as the fathers ate and died he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum. many therefore of his disciples when the heard [this] said this is a hard saying who can hear it but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this said unto them doth this cause you to stumble [what] then if ye should behold the son of man ascending where he was before it is the spirit that giveth life the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i have spoken unto you are spirit are are life.  but there are some of you that believe not. for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who it was that should betray him. and he said for this cause have i said unto you that no man can come unto me except it be given unto him of the father. upon this many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. jesus said therefore unto the twelve would ye also go away simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life. and we have believed and know that thou art the holy one of god. jesus answered them did not i choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil now he spake of judas [the son] of simon iscariot for he it was that should betray him [being] one of the twelve. and after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in judaea because the jews sought to kill him. now the feast of the jews the feast of tabernacles was at hand. his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.  for no man doeth anything in secret and himself seeketh to be known openly. if thou doest these things manifest thyself to the world. for even his brethren did not believe on him. jesus therefore saith unto them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready. the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that its works are evil. go ye up unto the feast i go not up unto this feast because my time is not yet fulfilled. and having said these things unto them he abode [still] in galilee. but when his brethren were gone up unto the feast then went he also up not publicly but as it were in secret. the jews therefore sought him at the feast and said where is he and there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him some said he is a good man others said not so but he leadeth the multitude astray. yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews. but when it was now the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught. the jews therefore marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned  jesus therefore answered them and said my teaching is not mine but his that sent me. if any man willeth to do his will he shall know of the teaching whether it is of god or [whether] i speak from myself. he that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him. did not moses give you the law and [yet] none of you doeth the law why seek ye to kill me the multitude answered thou hast a demon who seeketh to kill thee jesus answered and said unto them i did one work and ye all marvel because thereof. moses hath given you circumcision not that it is of moses but of the fathers and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man. if a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath that the law of moses may not be broken are ye wroth with me because i made a man every whit whole on the sabbath judge not according to appearance but judge righteous judgment. some therefore of them of jerusalem said is not this he whom they seek to kill  and lo he speaketh openly and they say nothing unto him. can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the christ howbeit we know this man whence he is but when the christ cometh no one knoweth whence he is. jesus therefore cried in the temple teaching and saying ye both know me and know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not. i know him because i am from him and he sent me. they sought therefore to take him and no man laid his hand on him because his hour was not yet come. but of the multitude many believed on him and they said when the christ shall come will he do more signs than those which this man hath done the pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to take him. jesus therefore said yet a little while am i with you and i go unto him that sent me. ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am ye cannot come.  the jews therefore said among themselves whither will this man go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks what is this word that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am ye cannot come now on the last day the great [day] of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink. he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said from within him shall flow rivers of living water. but this spake he of the spirit which they that believed on him were to receive for the spirit was not yet [given] because jesus was not yet glorified. [some] of the multitude therefore when they heard these words said this is of a truth the prophet. others said this is the christ. but some said what doth the christ come out of galilee hath not the scripture said that the christ cometh of the seed of david and from bethlehem the village where david was so there arose a division in the multitude because of him. and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him.  the officers therefore came to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why did ye not bring him the officers answered never man so spake. the pharisees therefore answered them are ye also led astray hath any of the rulers believed on him or of the pharisees but this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed. nicodemus saith unto them he that came to him before being one of them doth our law judge a man except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and see that out of galilee ariseth no prophet. and they went every man unto his own house but jesus went unto the mount of olives. and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them. and the scribes and the pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery and having set her in the midst they say unto him teacher this woman hath been taken in adultery in the very act. now in the law moses commanded us to stone such what then sayest thou of her  and this they said trying him that they might have [whereof] to accuse him. but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground. but when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her. and again he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground. and they when they heard it went out one by one beginning from the eldest [even] unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman where she was in the midst. and jesus lifted up himself and said unto her woman where are they did no man condemn thee and she said no man lord. and jesus said neither do i condemn thee go thy way from henceforth sin no more. again therefore jesus spake unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life. the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest witness of thyself thy witness is not true.  jesus answered and said unto them even if i bear witness of myself my witness is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye know not whence i come or whither i go. ye judge after the flesh i judge no man. yea and if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me. yea and in your law it is written that the witness of two men is true. i am he that beareth witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me. they said therefore unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye know neither me nor my father if ye knew me ye would know my father also. these words spake he in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man took him because his hour was not yet come. he said therefore again unto them i go away and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sin whither i go ye cannot come. the jews therefore said will he kill himself that he saith whither i go ye cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world.  i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for except ye believe that i am [he] ye shall die in your sins. they said therefore unto him who art thou jesus said unto them even that which i have also spoken unto you from the beginning. i have many things to speak and to judge concerning you howbeit he that sent me is true and the things which i heard from him these speak i unto the world. they perceived not that he spake to them of the father. jesus therefore said when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am [he] and [that] i do nothing of myself but as the father taught me i speak these things. and he that sent me is with me he hath not left me alone for i do always the things that are pleasing to him. as he spake these things many believed on him. jesus therefore said to those jews that had believed him if ye abide in my word [then] are ye truly my disciples and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. they answered unto him we are abrahams seed and have never yet been in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free  jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. and the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever the son abideth for ever. if therefore the son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed. i know that ye are abrahams seed yet ye seek to kill me because my word hath not free course in you. i speak the things which i have seen with [my] father and ye also do the things which ye heard from [your] father. they answered and said unto him our father is abraham. jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham. but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i heard from god this did not abraham. ye do the works of your father. they said unto him we were not born of fornication we have one father [even] god. jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i came forth and am come from god for neither have i come of myself but he sent me. why do ye not understand my speech [even] because ye cannot hear my word.  ye are of [your] father the devil and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. he was a murderer from the beginning and standeth not in the truth because there is no truth in him. when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father thereof. but because i say the truth ye believe me not. which of you convicteth me of sin if i say truth why do ye not believe me he that is of god heareth the words of god for this cause ye hear [them] not because ye are not of god. the jews answered and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a demon jesus answered i have not a demon but i honor my father and ye dishonor me. but i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth. verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my word he shall never see death. the jews said unto him now we know that thou hast a demon. abraham died and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my word he shall never taste of death. art thou greater than our father abraham who died and the prophets died whom makest thou thyself  jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing it is my father that glorifieth me of whom ye say that he is your god and ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be like unto you a liar but i know him and keep his word. your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad. the jews therefore said unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was born i am. they took up stones therefore to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. and as he passed by he saw a man blind from his birth. and his disciples asked him saying rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he should be born blind jesus answered neither did this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him. we must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work. when i am in the world i am the light of the world.  when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent. he went away therefore and washed and came seeing. the neighbors therefore and they that saw him aforetime that he was a beggar said is not this he that sat and begged others said it is he others said no but he is like him. he said i am [he]. they said therefore unto him how then were thine eyes opened he answered the man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to siloam and wash so i went away and washed and i received sight. and they said unto him where is he he saith i know not. they bring to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind. now it was the sabbath on the day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. again therefore the pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. and he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and i see.  some therefore of the pharisees said this man is not from god because he keepeth not the sabbath. but others said how can a man that is a sinner do such signs and there was division among them. they say therefore unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him in that he opened thine eyes and he said he is a prophet. the jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight and asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see his parents answered and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but how he now seeth we know not or who opened his eyes we know not ask him he is of age he shall speak for himself. these things said his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man should confess him [to be] christ he should be put out of the synagogue. therefore said his parents he is of age ask him.  so they called a second time the man that was blind and said unto him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner. he therefore answered whether he is a sinner i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see. they said therefore unto him what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes he answered them i told you even now and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again would ye also become his disciples and they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are disciples of moses. we know that god hath spoken unto moses but as for this man we know not whence he is. the man answered and said unto them why herein is the marvel that ye know not whence he is and [yet] he opened mine eyes. we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and do his will him he heareth. since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. if this man were not from god he could do nothing.  they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out. jesus heard that they had cast him out and finding him he said dost thou believe on the son of god he answered and said and who is he lord that i may believe on him jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and he it is that speaketh with thee. and he said lord i believe. and he worshipped him. and jesus said for judgment came i into this world that they that see not may see and that they that see may become blind. those of the pharisees who were with him heard these things and said unto him are we also blind jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye would have no sin but now ye say we see your sin remaineth. verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber. but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.  when he hath put forth all his own he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice. and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers.  this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. jesus therefore said unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep. all that came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them. i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture. the thief cometh not but that he may steal and kill and destroy i came that they may have life and may have [it] abundantly. i am the good shepherd the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. he that is a hireling and not a shepherd whose own the sheep are not beholdeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf snatcheth them and scattereth [them] [he fleeth] because he is a hireling and careth not for the sheep. i am the good shepherd and i know mine own and mine own know me  even as the father knoweth me and i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep. and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall become one flock one shepherd.  therefore doth the father love me because i lay down my life that i may take it again. no one taketh it away from me but i lay it down of myself. i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again. this commandment received i from my father. there arose a division again among the jews because of these words. and many of them said he hath a demon and is mad why hear ye him others said these are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. can a demon open the eyes of the blind and it was the feast of the dedication at jerusalem it was winter and jesus was walking in the temple in solomons porch. the jews therefore came round about him and said unto him how long dost thou hold us in suspense if thou art the christ tell us plainly. jesus answered them i told you and ye believe not the works that i do in my fathers name these bear witness of me.  but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep. my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.  my father who hath given [them] unto me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the fathers hand. i and the father are one. the jews took up stones again to stone him. jesus answered them many good works have i showed you from the father for which of those works do ye stone me the jews answered him for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god. jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am [the] son of god if i do not the works of my father believe me not.  but if i do them though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and understand that the father is in me and i in the father. they sought again to take him and he went forth out of their hand. and he went away again beyond the jordan into the place where john was at the first baptizing and there be abode. and many came unto him and they said john indeed did no sign but all things whatsoever john spake of this man were true. and many believed on him there. now a certain man was sick lazarus of bethany of the village of mary and her sister martha. and it was that mary who anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick. the sisters therefore sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick. but when jesus heard it he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god may be glorified thereby. now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus. when therefore he heard that he was sick he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.  then after this he saith to the disciples let us go into judaea again. the disciples say unto him rabbi the jews were but now seeking to stone thee and goest thou thither again jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if a man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world. but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because the light is not in him. these things spake he and after this he saith unto them our friend lazarus is fallen asleep but i go that i may awake him out of sleep. the disciples therefore said unto him lord if he is fallen asleep he will recover. now jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. then jesus therefore said unto them plainly lazarus is dead. and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him. thomas therefore who is called didymus said unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him. so when jesus came he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off  and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them concerning their brother. martha therefore when she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary still sat in the house. martha therefore said unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died. and even now i know that whatsoever thou shalt ask of god god will give thee. jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again. martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth on me though he die yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. believest thou this she saith unto him yea lord i have believed that thou art the christ the son of god [even] he that cometh into the world. and when she had said this she went away and called mary her sister secretly saying the teacher is her and calleth thee. and she when she heard it arose quickly and went unto him. now jesus was not yet come into the village but was still in the place where martha met him.  the jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her when they saw mary that she rose up quickly and went out followed her supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there. mary therefore when she came where jesus was and saw him fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died. when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews [also] weeping who came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they say unto him lord come and see. jesus wept. the jews therefore said behold how he loved him but some of them said could not this man who opened the eyes of him that was blind have caused that this man also should not die jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. now it was a cave and a stone lay against it. jesus saith take ye away the stone. martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time the body decayeth for he hath been [dead] four days. jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou believedst thou shouldest see the glory of god  so they took away the stone. and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou heardest me. and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the multitude that standeth around i said it that they may believe that thou didst send me. and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth. he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin. jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go. many therefore of the jews who came to mary and beheld that which he did believed on him. but some of them went away to the pharisees and told them the things which jesus had done. the chief priests therefore and the pharisees gathered a council and said what do we for this man doeth many signs. if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. but a certain one of them caiaphas being high priest that year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not.  now this he said not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for the nation and not for the nation only but that he might also gather together into one the children of god that are scattered abroad. so from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death. jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there he tarried with the disciples. now the passover of the jews was at hand and many went up to jerusalem out of the country before the passover to purify themselves. they sought therefore for jesus and spake one with another as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast now the chief priests and the pharisees had given commandment that if any man knew where he was he should show it that they might take him. jesus therefore six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was whom jesus raised from the dead. so they made him a supper there and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.  mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard very precious and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. but judas iscariot one of his disciples that should betray him saith why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings and given to the poor now this he said not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and having the bag took away what was put therein. jesus therefore said suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying. for the poor ye have always with you but me ye have not always. the common people therefore of the jews learned that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead. but the chief priests took counsel that they might put lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus. on the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem  took the branches of the palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried out hosanna blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the lord even the king of israel. and jesus having found a young ass sat thereon as it is written fear not daughter of zion behold thy king cometh sitting on an asss colt. these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him. the multitude therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bare witness. for this cause also the multitude went and met him for that they heard that he had done this sign. the pharisees therefore said among themselves behold how ye prevail nothing lo the world is gone after him. now there were certain greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast these therefore came to philip who was of bethsaida of galilee and asked him saying sir we would see jesus. philip cometh and telleth andrew andrew cometh and philip and they tell jesus.  and jesus answereth them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified. verily verily i say unto you except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die it abideth by itself alone but if it die it beareth much fruit. he that loveth his life loseth it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will the father honor. now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour. but for this cause came i unto this hour. father glorify thy name. there came therefore a voice out of heaven [saying] i have both glorified it and will glorify it again. the multitude therefore that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered others said an angel hath spoken to him. jesus answered and said this voice hath not come for my sake but for your sakes. now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out. and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto myself. but this he said signifying by what manner of death he should die.  the multitude therefore answered him we have heard out of the law that the christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man jesus therefore said unto them yet a little while is the light among you. walk while ye have the light that darkness overtake you not and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. while ye have the light believe on the light that ye may become sons of light. these things spake jesus and he departed and hid himself from them. but though he had done so many signs before them yet they believed not on him that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed for this cause they could not believe for that isaiah said again he hath blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart and should turn and i should heal them. these things said isaiah because he saw his glory and he spake of him.  nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess [it] lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the glory [that is] of men more than the glory [that is] of god. and jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me. and he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness. and if any man hear my sayings and keep them not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world. he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my sayings hath one that judgeth him the word that i spake the same shall judge him in the last day. for i spake not from myself but the father that sent me he hath given me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak. and i know that his commandment is life eternal the things therefore which i speak even as the father hath said unto me so i speak.  now before the feast of the passover jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his father having loved his own that were in the world he loved them unto the end. and during supper the devil having already put into the heart of judas iscariot simons [son] to betray him [jesus] knowing that the father had given all the things into his hands and that he came forth from god and goeth unto god riseth from supper and layeth aside his garments and he took a towel and girded himself. then he poureth water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. so he cometh to simon peter. he saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt understand hereafter. peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet. jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me. simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head.  jesus saith to him he that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all. for he knew him that should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean. so when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you ye call me teacher and lord and ye say well for so i am. if i then the lord and the teacher have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet. for i have given you an example that ye also should do as i have done to you. verily verily i say unto you a servant is not greater than his lord neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him. if ye know these things blessed are ye if ye do them. i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me. from henceforth i tell you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am [he]. verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  when jesus had thus said he was troubled in the spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me. the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake. there was at the table reclining in jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved. simon peter therefore beckoneth to him and saith unto him tell [us] who it is of whom he speaketh. he leaning back as he was on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it jesus therefore answereth he it is for whom i shall dip the sop and give it him. so when he had dipped the sop he taketh and giveth it to judas [the son] of simon iscariot. and after the sop then entered satan into him. jesus therefore saith unto him what thou doest do quickly. now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. for some thought because judas had the bag that jesus said unto him buy what things we have need of for the feast or that he should give something to the poor. he then having received the sop went out straightway and it was night.  when therefore he was gone out jesus saith now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him and god shall glorify him in himself and straightway shall he glorify him. little children yet a little while i am with you. ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say unto you. a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another even as i have loved you that ye also love one another. by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another. simon peter saith unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered whither i go thou canst not follow now but thou shalt follow afterwards. peter saith unto him lord why cannot i follow thee even now i will lay down my life for thee. jesus answereth wilt thou lay down thy life for me verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice. let not your heart be troubled believe in god believe also in me. in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you for i go to prepare a place for you.  and if i go and prepare a place for you i come again and will receive you unto myself that where i am [there] ye may be also.  and whither i go ye know the way. thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest how know we the way jesus saith unto him i am the way and the truth and the life no one cometh unto the father but by me. if ye had known me ye would have known my father also from henceforth ye know him and have seen him. philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us. jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and dost thou not know me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father how sayest thou show us the father believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i say unto you i speak not from myself but the father abiding in me doeth his works. believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake. verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater [works] than these shall he do because i go unto the father.  and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son.  if ye shall ask anything in my name that will i do. if ye love me ye will keep my commandments. and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may be with you for ever [even] the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive for it beholdeth him not neither knoweth him ye know him for he abideth with you and shall be in you. i will not leave you desolate i come unto you. yet a little while and the world beholdeth me no more but ye behold me because i live ye shall live also. in that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you. he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself unto him. judas not iscariot saith unto him lord what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.  he that loveth me not keepeth not my words and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers who sent me. these things have i spoken unto you while [yet] abiding with you. but the comforter [even] the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that i said unto you. peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you. let not your heart be troubled neither let it be fearful. ye heard how i said to you i go away and i come unto you. if ye loved me ye would have rejoiced because i go unto the father for the father is greater than i. and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye may believe. i will no more speak much with you for the prince of the world cometh and he hath nothing in me but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do. arise let us go hence. i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman.  every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh it away and every [branch] that beareth fruit he cleanseth it that it may bear more fruit. already ye are clean because of the word which i have spoken unto you. abide in me and i in you. as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine so neither can ye except ye abide in me. i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same beareth much fruit for apart from me ye can do nothing. if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned. if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatsoever ye will and it shall be done unto you. herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit and [so] shall ye be my disciples. even as the father hath loved me i also have loved you abide ye in my love. if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love. these things have i spoken unto you that my joy may be in you and [that] your joy may be made full.  this is my commandment that ye love one another even as i have loved you. greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends. ye are my friends if ye do the things which i command you. no longer do i call you servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i heard from my father i have made known unto you. ye did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you that ye should go and bear fruit and [that] your fruit should abide that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you. these things i command you that ye may love one another. if the world hateth you ye know that it hath hated me before [it hated] you. if ye were of the world the world would love its own but because ye are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hateth you. remember the word that i said unto you a servant is not greater than his lord. if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also. but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me.  if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no excuse for their sin. he that hateth me hateth my father also. if i had not done among them the works which none other did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father. but [this cometh to pass] that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause. but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father [even] the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall bear witness of me and ye also bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning. these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be caused to stumble. they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the hour cometh that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto god. and these things will they do because they have not known the father nor me.  but these things have i spoken unto you that when their hour is come ye may remember them how that i told you. and these things i said not unto you from the beginning because i was with you. but now i go unto him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou but because i have spoken these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i go i will send him unto you. and he when he is come will convict the world in respect of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to the father and ye behold me no more of judgment because the prince of this world hath been judged. i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now. howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he shall guide you into all the truth for he shall not speak from himself but what things soever he shall hear [these] shall he speak and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.  he shall glorify me for he shall take of mine and shall declare [it] unto you. all things whatsoever the father hath are mine therefore said i that he taketh of mine and shall declare [it] unto you. a little while and ye behold me no more and again a little while and ye shall see me. [some] of his disciples therefore said one to another what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye behold me not and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we know not what he saith. jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him and he said unto them do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this that i said a little while and ye behold me not and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but when she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world.  and ye therefore now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no one taketh away from you. and in that day ye shall ask me no question. verily verily i say unto you if ye shall ask anything of the father he will give it you in my name. hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be made full. these things have i spoken unto you in dark sayings the hour cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings but shall tell you plainly of the father. in that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came forth from the father. i came out from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go unto the father. his disciples say lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no dark saying. now know we that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god. jesus answered them do ye now believe  behold the hour cometh yea is come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and [yet] i am not alone because the father is with me. these things have i spoken unto you that in me ye may have peace. in the world ye have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world. these things spake jesus and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said father the hour is come glorify thy son that the son may glorify thee even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh that to all whom thou hast given him he should give eternal life. and this is life eternal that they should know thee the only true god and him whom thou didst send [even] jesus christ. i glorified thee on the earth having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do. and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was. i manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them to me and they have kept thy word. now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee  for the words which thou gavest me i have given unto them and they received [them] and knew of a truth that i came forth from thee and they believed that thou didst send me. i pray for them i pray not for the world but for those whom thou hast given me for they are thine and all things that are mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them. and i am no more in the world and these are in the world and i come to thee. holy father keep them in thy name which thou hast given me that they may be one even as we [are]. while i was with them i kept them in thy name which thou hast given me and i guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled. but now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world that they may have my joy made full in themselves. i have given them thy word and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world. i pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil [one]. they are not of the world even as i am not of the world.  sanctify them in the truth thy word is truth. as thou didst send me into the world even so sent i them into the world. and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. neither for these only do i pray but for them also that believe on me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father [art] in me and i in thee that they also may be in us that the world may believe that thou didst send me. and the glory which thou hast given me i have given unto them that they may be one even as we [are] one i in them and thou in me that they may be perfected into one that the world may know that thou didst send me and lovedst them even as thou lovedst me. father i desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. o righteous father the world knew thee not but i knew thee and these knew that thou didst send me and i made known unto them thy name and will make it known that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them and i in them.  when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook kidron where was a garden into which he entered himself and his disciples. now judas also who betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. judas then having received the band [of soldiers] and officers from the chief priests and the pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him went forth and saith unto them whom seek ye they answered him jesus of nazareth. jesus saith unto them i am [he]. and judas also who betrayed him was standing with them. when therefore he said unto them i am [he] they went backward and fell to the ground. again therefore he asked them whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth. jesus answered i told you that i am [he] if therefore ye seek me let these go their way that the word might be fulfilled which he spake of those whom thou hast given me i lost not one.  simon peter therefore having a sword drew it and struck the high priests servant and cut off his right ear. now the servants name was malchus. jesus therefore said unto peter put up the sword into the sheath the cup which the father hath given me shall i not drink it so the band and the chief captain and the officers of the jews seized jesus and bound him and led him to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas who was high priest that year. now caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. and simon peter followed jesus and [so did] another disciple. now that disciple was known unto the high priest and entered in with jesus into the court of the high priest but peter was standing at the door without. so the other disciple who was known unto the high priest went out and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter. the maid therefore that kept the door saith unto peter art thou also [one] of this mans disciples he saith i am not.  now the servants and the officers were standing [there] having made a fire of coals for it was cold and they were warming themselves and peter also was with them standing and warming himself. the high priest therefore asked jesus of his disciples and of his teaching. jesus answered him i have spoken openly to the world i ever taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together and in secret spake i nothing. why askest thou me ask them that have heard [me] what i spake unto them behold these know the things which i said. and when he had said this one of the officers standing by struck jesus with his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me annas therefore sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest. now simon peter was standing and warming himself. they said therefore unto him art thou also [one] of his disciples he denied and said i am not. one of the servants of the high priest being a kinsman of him whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him  peter therefore denied again and straightway the cock crew. they lead jesus therefore from caiaphas into the praetorium and it was early and they themselves entered not into the praetorium that they might not be defiled but might eat the passover. pilate therefore went out unto them and saith what accusation bring ye against this man they answered and said unto him if this man were not an evildoer we should not have delivered him up unto thee. pilate therefore said unto them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law. the jews said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death that the word of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying by what manner of death he should die. pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered sayest thou this of thyself or did others tell it thee concerning me pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me what hast thou done  jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence. pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king. to this end have i been born and to this end am i come into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth. every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find no crime in him. but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews they cried out therefore again saying not this man but barabbas. now barabbas was a robber. then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him. and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple garment and they came unto him and said hail king of the jews and they struck him with their hands. and pilate went out again and saith unto them behold i bring him out to you that ye may know that i find no crime in him.  jesus therefore came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. and [pilate] saith unto them behold the man when therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying crucify [him] crucify [him] pilate saith unto them take him yourselves and crucify him for i find no crime in him. the jews answered him we have a law and by that law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god. when pilate therefore heard this saying he was the more afraid and he entered into the praetorium again and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer. pilate therefore saith unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to release thee and have power to crucify thee jesus answered him thou wouldest have no power against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. upon this pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou release this man thou art not caesars friend every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar.  when pilate therefore heard these words he brought jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the pavement but in hebrew gabbatha. now it was the preparation of the passover it was about the sixth hour. and he saith unto the jews behold your king they therefore cried out away with [him] away with [him] crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar. then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified. they took jesus therefore and he went out bearing the cross for himself unto the place called the place of a skull which is called in hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and with him two others on either side one and jesus in the midst. and pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. and there was written jesus of nazareth the king of the jews. this title therefore read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew [and] in latin [and] in greek.  the chief priests of the jews therefore said to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews.  pilate answered what i have written i have written. the soldiers therefore when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also the coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout. they said therefore one to another let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots. these things therefore the soldiers did. but there were standing by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the [wife] of clopas and mary magdalene. when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home]. after this jesus knowing that all things are now finished that the scripture might be accomplished saith i thirst.  there was set there a vessel full of vinegar so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop and brought it to his mouth.  when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath for the day of that sabbath was a high [day] asked of pilate that their legs might be broken and [that] they might be taken away. the soldiers therefore came and brake the legs of the first and of the other that was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and straightway there came out blood and water. and he that hath seen hath borne witness and his witness is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye also may believe. for these things came to pass that the scripture might be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken. and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced.  and after these things joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews asked of pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave [him] leave. he came therefore and took away his body. and there came also nicodemus he who at the first came to him by night bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pounds. so they took the body of jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices as the custom of the jews is to bury. now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid. there then because of the jews preparation for the tomb was nigh at hand they laid jesus. now on the first [day] of the week cometh mary magdalene early while it was yet dark unto the tomb and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb. she runneth therefore and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the tomb and we know not where they have laid him. peter therefore went forth and the other disciple and they went toward the tomb.  and they ran both together and the other disciple outran peter and came first to the tomb and stooping and looking in he seeth the linen cloths lying yet entered he not in. simon peter therefore also cometh following him and entered into the tomb and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying and the napkin that was upon his head not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb and he saw and believed. for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise from the dead. so the disciples went away again unto their own home. but mary was standing without at the tomb weeping so as she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of jesus had lain. and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him. when she had thus said she turned herself back and beholdeth jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus.  jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou hast borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away. jesus saith unto her mary. she turneth herself and saith unto him in hebrew rabboni which is to say teacher. jesus saith to her touch me not for i am not yet ascended unto the father but go unto my brethren and say to them i ascend unto my father and your father and my god and your god. mary magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples i have seen the lord and [that] he had said these things unto her. when therefore it was evening on that day the first [day] of the week and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the jews jesus came and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace [be] unto you. and when he had said this he showed unto them his hands and his side. the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the lord. jesus therefore said to them again peace [be] unto you as the father hath sent me even so send i you.  and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy spirit whose soever sins ye forgive they are forgiven unto them whose soever [sins] ye retain they are retained. but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came. the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord. but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my hand into his side i will not believe. and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them. jesus cometh the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace [be] unto you. then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and see my hands and reach [hither] thy hand and put it into my side and be not faithless but believing. thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god. jesus saith unto him because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed [are] they that have not seen and [yet] have believed. many other signs therefore did jesus in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book  but these are written that ye may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye may have life in his name. after these things jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and he manifested [himself] on this wise. there was together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the [sons] of zebedee and two other of his disciples. simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing. they say unto him we also come with thee. they went forth and entered into the boat and that night they took nothing. but when day was now breaking jesus stood on the beach yet the disciples knew not that it was jesus. jesus therefore saith unto them children have ye aught to eat they answered him no. and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the boat and ye shall find. they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  that disciple therefore whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord. so when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his coat about him for he was naked and cast himself into the sea. but the other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land but about two hundred cubits off dragging the net [full] of fishes. so when they got out upon the land they see a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread. jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now taken. simon peter therefore went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes a hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many the net was not rent. jesus saith unto them come [and] break your fast. and none of the disciples durst inquire of him who art thou knowing that it was the lord. jesus cometh and taketh the bread and giveth them and the fish likewise. this is now the third time that jesus was manifested to the disciples after that he was risen from the dead.  so when they had broken their fast jesus saith to simon peter simon [son] of john lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee. he saith unto him feed my lambs. he saith to him again a second time simon [son] of john lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee. he saith unto him tend my sheep. he saith unto him the third time simon [son] of john lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee. jesus saith unto him feed my sheep. verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. now this he spake signifying by what manner of death he should glorify god. and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me.  peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following who also leaned back on his breast at the supper and said lord who is he that betrayeth thee peter therefore seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what [is that] to thee follow thou me. this saying therefore went forth among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him that he should not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what [is that] to thee this is the disciple that beareth witness of these things and wrote these things and we know that his witness is true. and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written. the former treatise i made o theophilus concerning all that jesus began both to do and to teach until the day in which he was received up after that he had given commandment through the holy spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen  to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs appearing unto them by the space of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them he charged them not to depart from jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the father which [said he] ye heard from me for john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit not many days hence. they therefore when they were come together asked him saying lord dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father hath set within his own authority. but ye shall receive power when the holy spirit is come upon you and ye shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem and in all judaea and samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. and when he had said these things as they were looking he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight. and while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went behold two men stood by them in white apparel  who also said ye men of galilee why stand ye looking into heaven this jesus who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven. then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is nigh unto jerusalem a sabbath days journey off. and when they were come in they went up into the upper chamber where they were abiding both peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james [the son] of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas [the son] of james. these all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren. and in these days peter stood up in the midst of the brethren and said and there was a multitude of persons [gathered] together about a hundred and twenty brethren it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled which the holy spirit spake before by the mouth of david concerning judas who was guide to them that took jesus. for he was numbered among us and received his portion in this ministry.  now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out. and it became known to all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch that in their language that field was called akeldama that is the field of blood. for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be made desolate and let no man dwell therein and his office let another take. of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and went out among us beginning from the baptism of john unto the day that he was received up from us of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection. and they put forward two joseph called barsabbas who was surnamed justus and matthias. and they prayed and said thou lord who knowest the hearts of all men show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas fell away that he might go to his own place. and they gave lots for them and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.  and when the day of pentecost was now come they were all together in one place. and suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting. and there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder like as of fire and it sat upon each one of them. and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. now there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men from every nation under heaven. and when this sound was heard the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. and they were all amazed and marvelled saying behold are not all these that speak galilaeans and how hear we every man in our own language wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia in phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene and sojourners from rome both jews and proselytes  cretans and arabians we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of god. and they were all amazed and were perplexed saying one to another what meaneth this but others mocking said they are filled with new wine. but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and spake forth unto them [saying] ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and give ear unto my words. for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day. but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet joel and it shall be in the last days saith god i will pour forth of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days will i pour forth of my spirit and they shall prophesy. and i will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the lord come that great and notable [day].  and it shall be that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved. ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you even as ye yourselves know him being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay whom god raised up having loosed the pangs of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. for david saith concerning him i beheld the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul unto hades neither wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption. thou madest known unto me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance. brethren i may say unto you freely of the patriarch david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us unto this day.  being therefore a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins he would set [one] upon his throne he foreseeing [this] spake of the resurrection of the christ that neither was he left unto hades nor did his flesh see corruption. this jesus did god raise up whereof we all are witnesses. being therefore by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy spirit he hath poured forth this which ye see and hear. for david ascended not into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. let all the house of israel therefore know assuredly that god hath made him both lord and christ this jesus whom ye crucified. now when they heard [this] they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles brethren what shall we do and peter [said] unto them repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ unto the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy spirit.  for to you is the promise and to your children and to all that are afar off [even] as many as the lord our god shall call unto him. and with many other words he testified and exhorted them saying save yourselves from this crooked generation. they then that received his word were baptized and there were added [unto them] in that day about three thousand souls. and they continued stedfastly in the apostles teaching and fellowship in the breaking of bread and the prayers. and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. and all that believed were together and had all things common and they sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all according as any man had need. and day by day continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread at home they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people. and the lord added to them day by day those that were saved. now peter and john were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer [being] the ninth [hour].  and a certain man that was lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple  who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked to receive an alms. and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us. and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something from them. but peter said silver and gold have i none but what i have that give i thee. in the name of jesus christ of nazareth walk. and he took him by the right hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and his anklebones received strength. and leaping up he stood and began to walk and he entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god. and all the people saw him walking and praising god and they took knowledge of him that it was he that sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.  and as he held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons greatly wondering. and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this man or why fasten ye your eyes on us as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk  the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his servant jesus whom ye delivered up and denied before the face of pilate when he had determined to release him. but ye denied the holy and righteous one and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the prince of life whom god raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses. and by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong whom ye behold and know yea the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. and now brethren i know that in ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers. but the things which god foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets that his christ should suffer he thus fulfilled.  repent ye therefore and turn again that your sins may be blotted out that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the lord and that he may send the christ who hath been appointed for you [even] jesus whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things whereof god spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old.  moses indeed said a prophet shall the lord god raise up unto you from among your brethren like unto me. to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you. and it shall be that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people. yea and all the prophets from samuel and them that followed after as many as have spoken they also told of these days. ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with your fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. unto you first god having raised up his servant sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.  and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them being sore troubled because they taught the people and proclaimed in jesus the resurrection from the dead. and they laid hands on them and put them in ward unto the morrow for it was now eventide. but many of them that heard the word believed and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in jerusalem and annas the high priest [was there] and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest. and when they had set them in the midst they inquired by what power or in what name have ye done this then peter filled with the holy spirit said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man by what means this man is made whole  be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead [even] in him doth this man stand here before you whole. he is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders which was made the head of the corner. and in none other is there salvation for neither is there any other name under heaven that is given among men wherein we must be saved. now when they beheld the boldness of peter and john and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus. and seeing the man that was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it. but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them is manifest to all that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it. but that it spread no further among the people let us threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  and they called them and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus. but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it is right in the sight of god to hearken unto you rather than unto god judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. and they when they had further threatened them let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done. for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was wrought. and being let go they came to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. and they when they heard it lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said o lord thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the holy spirit [by] the mouth of our father david thy servant didst say why did the gentiles rage and the peoples imagine vain things the kings of the earth set themselves in array and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his anointed  for of a truth in this city against thy holy servant jesus whom thou didst anoint both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel were gathered together to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass. and now lord look upon their threatenings and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy servant jesus. and when they had prayed the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together and they were all filled with the holy spirit and they spake the word of god with boldness. and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul and not one [of them] said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common. and with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all.  for neither was there among them any that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto each according as any one had need. and joseph who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted son of exhortation a levite a man of cyprus by race having a field sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet. but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back [part] of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet. but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thy heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back [part] of the price of the land while it remained did it not remain thine own and after it was sold was it not in thy power how is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart thou has not lied unto men but unto god. and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came upon all that heard it.  and the young men arose and wrapped him round and they carried him out and buried him. and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in. and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. and she said yea for so much. but peter [said] unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to try the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door and they shall carry thee out. and she fell down immediately at his feet and gave up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. and great fear came upon the whole church and upon all that heard these things. and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons porch. but of the rest durst no man join himself to them howbeit the people magnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of them and women  insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that as peter came by at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. and there also came together the multitudes from the cities round about jerusalem bring sick folk and them that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one. but the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and they were filled with jealousy and laid hands on the apostles and put them in public ward. but an angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them out and said go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. and when they heard [this] they entered into the temple about daybreak and taught. but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison house to have them brought. but the officers that came found them not in the prison and they returned and told  saying the prisonhouse we found shut in all safety and the keepers standing at the doors but when we had opened we found no man within. now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow. and there came one and told them behold the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people. then went the captain with the officers and brought them [but] without violence for they feared the people lest they should be stoned. and when they had brought them they set them before the council. and the high priest asked them saying we strictly charged you not to teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this mans blood upon us. but peter and the apostles answered and said we must obey god rather than men. the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew hanging him on a tree. him did god exalt with his right hand [to be] a prince and a saviour to give repentance to israel and remission of sins.  and we are witnesses of these things and [so is] the holy spirit whom god hath given to them that obey him. but they when they heard this were cut to the heart and minded to slay them. but there stood up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in honor of all the people and commanded to put the men forth a little while. and he said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves as touching these men what ye are about to do. for before these days rose up theudas giving himself out to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were dispersed and came to nought. after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the enrolment and drew away [some of the] people after him he also perished and all as many as obeyed him were scattered abroad. and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will be overthrown but if it is of god ye will not be able to overthrow them lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against god.  and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles unto them they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go. they therefore departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. and every day in the temple and at home they ceased not to teach and to preach jesus [as] the christ. now in these days when the number of the disciples was multiplying there arose a murmuring of the grecian jews against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. and the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not fit that we should forsake the word of god and serve tables. look ye out therefore brethren from among you seven men of good report full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint over this business. but we will continue stedfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.  and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolaus a proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands upon them. and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem exceedingly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. and stephen full of grace and power wrought great wonders and signs among the people. but there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called [the synagogue] of the libertines and of the cyrenians and of the alexandrians and of them of cilicia and asia disputing with stephen. and they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. then they suborned men who said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and [against] god. and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and seized him and brought him into the council  and set up false witnesses who said this man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered unto us. and all that sat in the council fastening their eyes on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. and the high priest said are these things so and he said brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in haran and said unto him get thee out of thy land and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall show thee. then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in haran and from thence when his father was dead [god] removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on and he promised that he would give it to him in possession and to his seed after him when [as yet] he had no child.  and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and treat them ill four hundred years. and the nation to which they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place. and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so [abraham] begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac [begat] jacob and jacob the twelve patriarchs. and the patriarchs moved with jealousy against joseph sold him into egypt and god was with him and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house. now there came a famine over all egypt and canaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance. but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent forth our fathers the first time. and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs race became manifest unto pharaoh.  and joseph sent and called to him jacob his father and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls. and jacob went down into egypt and he died himself and our fathers and they were carried over unto shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of hamor in shechem. but as the time of the promise drew nigh which god vouchsafed unto abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt till there arose another king over egypt who knew not joseph. the same dealt craftily with our race and ill treated our fathers that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live. at which season moses was born and was exceeding fair and he was nourished three months in his fathers house. and when he was cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son. and moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and he was mighty in his words and works. but when he was wellnigh forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel.  and seeing one [of them] suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed smiting the egyptian and he supposed that his brethren understood that god by his hand was giving them deliverance but they understood not. and the day following he appeared unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us wouldest thou kill me as thou killedst the egyptian yesterday and moses fled at this saying and became a sojourner in the land of midian where he begat two sons. and when forty years were fulfilled an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in a flame of fire in a bush. and when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold there came a voice of the lord i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob. and moses trembled and durst not behold.  and the lord said unto him loose the shoes from thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. i have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in egypt and have heard their groaning and i am come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt. this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge him hath god sent [to be] both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush. this man led them forth having wrought wonders and signs in egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years. this is that moses who said unto the children of israel a prophet shall god raise up unto you from among your brethren like unto me. this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount sinai and with our fathers who received living oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not be obedient but thrust him from them and turned back in their hearts unto egypt saying unto aaron make us gods that shall go before us for as for this moses who led us forth out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him.  and they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands. but god turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel and ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of the god rephan the figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon. our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness even as he appointed who spake unto moses that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.  which also our fathers in their turn brought in with joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations that god thrust out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favor in the sight of god and asked to find a habitation for the god of jacob. but solomon built him a house. howbeit the most high dwelleth not in [houses] made with hands as saith the prophet  the heaven is my throne and the earth the footstool of my feet what manner of house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest did not my hand make all these things ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy spirit as your fathers did so do ye. which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the righteous one of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels and kept it not. now when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  but he being full of the holy spirit looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god. but they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed upon him with one accord  and they cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named saul. and they stoned stephen calling upon [the lord] and saying lord jesus receive my spirit. and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge. and when he had said this he fell asleep. and saul was consenting unto his death. and there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles. and devout men buried stephen and made great lamentation over him. but saul laid waste the church entering into every house and dragging men and women committed them to prison.  they therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word. and philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed unto them the christ. and the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by philip when they heard and saw the signs which he did.  for [from] many of those that had unclean spirits they came out crying with a loud voice and many that were palsied and that were lame were healed. and there was much joy in that city. but there was a certain man simon by name who beforetime in the city used sorcery and amazed the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is that power of god which is called great. and they gave heed to him because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. but when they believed philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women. and simon also himself believed and being baptized he continued with philip and beholding signs and great miracles wrought he was amazed. now when the apostles that were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit  for as yet it was fallen upon none of them only they had been baptized into the name of the lord jesus. then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy spirit. now when simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles hands the holy spirit was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay my hands he may receive the holy spirit. but peter said unto him thy silver perish with thee because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of god with money. thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right before god. repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray the lord if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. for i see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. and simon answered and said pray ye for me to the lord that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me. they therefore when they had testified and spoken the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel to many villages of the samaritans.  but an angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza the same is desert. and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who was over all her treasure who had come to jerusalem to worship and he was returning and sitting in his chariot and was reading the prophet isaiah. and the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot. and philip ran to him and heard him reading isaiah the prophet and said understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can i except some one shall guide me and he besought philip to come up and sit with him. now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb so he openeth not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away his generation who shall declare for his life is taken from the earth.  and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other and philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture preached unto him jesus. and as they went on the way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch saith behold [here is] water what doth hinder me to be baptized [and philip said if thou believest with all thy heart thou mayest. and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god.] and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they both went down into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him. and when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip and the eunuch saw him no more for he went on his way rejoicing. but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities till he came to caesarea. but saul yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest  and asked of him letters to damascus unto the synagogues that if he found any that were of the way whether men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem. and as he journeyed it came to pass that he drew nigh unto damascus and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven and he fell upon the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou lord and he [said] i am jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and enter into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do. and the men that journeyed with him stood speechless hearing the voice but beholding no man. and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw nothing and they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus. and he was three days without sight and did neither eat nor drink. now there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and the lord said unto him in a vision ananias. and he said behold i [am here] lord.  and the lord [said] unto him arise and go to the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of judas for one named saul a man of tarsus for behold he prayeth and he hath seen a man named ananias coming in and laying his hands on him that he might receive his sight. but ananias answered lord i have heard from many of this man how much evil he did to thy saints at jerusalem and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how many things he must suffer for my names sake. and ananias departed and entered into the house and laying his hands on him said brother saul the lord [even] jesus who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest hath sent me that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy spirit. and straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales and he received his sight and he arose and was baptized and he took food and was strengthened. and he was certain days with the disciples that were at damascus.  and straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed jesus that he is the son of god. and all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that in jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name and he had come hither for this intent that he might bring them bound before the chief priests. but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews that dwelt at damascus proving that this is the christ. and when many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel together to kill him but their plot became known to saul. and they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall lowering him in a basket. and when he was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples and they were all afraid of him not believing that he was a disciple. but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how at damascus he had preached boldly in the name of jesus.  and he was with them going in and going out at jerusalem preaching boldly in the name of the lord and he spake and disputed against the grecian jews but they were seeking to kill him. and when the brethren knew it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus. so the church throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria had peace being edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit was multiplied. and it came to pass as peter went throughout all parts he came down also to the saints that dwelt at lydda. and there he found a certain man named aeneas who had kept his bed eight years for he was palsied. and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ healeth thee arise and make thy bed. and straightway he arose. and all that dwelt at lydda and in sharon saw him and they turned to the lord. now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.  and it came to pass in those days that she fell sick and died and when they had washed her they laid her in an upper chamber. and as lydda was nigh unto joppa the disciples hearing that peter was there sent two men unto him entreating him delay not to come on unto us. and peter arose and went with them. and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them. but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning to the body he said tabitha arise. and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up. and he gave her his hand and raised her up and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive. and it became known throughout all joppa and many believed on the lord. and it came to pass that he abode many days in joppa with one simon a tanner. now [there was] a certain man in caesarea cornelius by name a centurion of the band called the italian [band]  a devout man and one that feared god with all his house who gave much alms to the people and prayed to god always. he saw in a vision openly as it were about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in unto him and saying to him cornelius. and he fastening his eyes upon him and being affrighted said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before god. and now send men to joppa and fetch one simon who is surnamed peter he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side. and when the angel that spake unto him was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and having rehearsed all things unto them he sent them to joppa. now on the morrow as they were on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour and he became hungry and desired to eat but while they made ready he fell into a trance  and he beholdeth the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending as it were a great sheet let down by four corners upon the earth wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat. but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. and a voice [came] unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed make not thou common. and this was done thrice and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven. now while peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean behold the men that were sent by cornelius having made inquiry for simons house stood before the gate and called and asked whether simon who was surnamed peter were lodging there. and while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee. but arise and get thee down and go with them nothing doubting for i have sent them.  and peter went down to the men and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come and they said cornelius a centurion a righteous man and one that feareth god and well reported of by all the nation of the jews was warned [of god] by a holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words from thee. so he called them in and lodged them. and on the morrow he arose and went forth with them and certain of the brethren from joppa accompanied him. and on the morrow they entered into caesarea. and cornelius was waiting for them having called together his kinsmen and his near friends. and when it came to pass that peter entered cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him. but peter raised him up saying stand up i myself also am a man. and as he talked with him he went in and findeth many come together  and he said unto them ye yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation and [yet] unto me hath god showed that i should not call any man common or unclean wherefore also i came without gainsaying when i was sent for. i ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me. and cornelius said four days ago until this hour i was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright apparel and saith cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god. send therefore to joppa and call unto thee simon who is surnamed peter he lodgeth in the house of simon a tanner by the sea side. forthwith therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come. now therefore we are all here present in the sight of god to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the lord. and peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to him.  the word which he sent unto the children of israel preaching good tidings of peace by jesus christ he is lord of all.  that saying ye yourselves know which was published throughout all judaea beginning from galilee after the baptism which john preached [even] jesus of nazareth how god anointed him with the holy spirit and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him. and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the jews and in jerusalem whom also they slew hanging him on a tree. him god raised up the third day and gave him to be made manifest not to all the people but unto witnesses that were chosen before of god [even] to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. and he charged us to preach unto the people and to testify that this is he who is ordained of god [to be] the judge of the living and the dead. to him bear all the prophets witness that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.  while peter yet spake these words the holy spirit fell on all them that heard the word. and they of the circumcision that believed were amazed as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy spirit. for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god. then answered peter can any man forbid the water that these should not be baptized who have received the holy spirit as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ. then prayed they him to tarry certain days. now the apostles and the brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god. and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them. but peter began and expounded [the matter] unto them in order saying i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descending as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even unto me  upon which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven. and i heard also a voice saying unto me rise peter kill and eat. but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. but a voice answered the second time out of heaven what god hath cleansed make not thou common. and this was done thrice and all were drawn up again into heaven. and behold forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were having been sent from caesarea unto me. and the spirit bade me go with them making no distinction. and these six brethren also accompanied me and we entered into the mans house and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and fetch simon whose surname is peter who shall speak unto thee words whereby thou shalt be saved thou and all thy house. and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell on them even as on us at the beginning.  and i remembered the word of the lord how he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit. if then god gave unto them the like gift as [he did] also unto us when we believed on the lord jesus christ who was i that i could withstand god and when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then to the gentiles also hath god granted repentance unto life. they therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about stephen travelled as far as phoenicia and cyprus and antioch speaking the word to none save only to jews. but there were some of them men of cyprus and cyrene who when they were come to antioch spake unto the greeks also preaching the lord jesus. and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number that believed turned unto the lord. and the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas as far as antioch  who when he was come and had seen the grace of god was glad and he exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord  for he was a good man and full of the holy spirit and of faith and much people was added unto the lord. and he went forth to tarsus to seek for saul and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch. and it came to pass that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church and taught much people and that the disciples were called christians first in antioch. now in these days there came down prophets from jerusalem unto antioch. and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius. and the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in judea which also they did sending it to the elders by the hand of barnabas and saul. now about that time herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. and he killed james the brother of john with the sword.  and when he saw that it pleased the jews he proceeded to seize peter also. and [those] were the days of unleavened bread.  and when he had taken him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people. peter therefore was kept in the prison but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto god for him. and when herod was about to bring him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and guards before the door kept the prison. and behold an angel of the lord stood by him and a light shined in the cell and he smote peter on the side and awoke him saying rise up quickly. and his chains fell off from his hands. and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals. and he did so. and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me. and he went out and followed and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision.  and when they were past the first and the second guard they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city which opened to them of its own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and straightway the angel departed from him.  and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a truth that the lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews. and when he had considered [the thing] he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together and were praying. and when he knocked at the door of the gate a maid came to answer named rhoda. and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for joy but ran in and told that peter stood before the gate. and they said unto her thou art mad. but she confidently affirmed that it was even so. and they said it is his angel. but peter continued knocking and when they had opened they saw him and were amazed.  but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him forth out of the prison. and he said tell these things unto james and to the brethren. and he departed and went to another place. now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter. and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the guards and commanded that they should be put to death. and he went down from judaea to caesarea and tarried there. now he was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon and they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend they asked for peace because their country was fed from the kings country. and upon a set day herod arrayed himself in royal apparel and sat on the throne and made an oration unto them. and the people shouted [saying] the voice of a god and not of a man. and immediately an angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost. but the word of god grew and multiplied.  and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministration taking with them john whose surname was mark. now there were at antioch in the church that was [there] prophets and teachers barnabas and symeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen the fosterbrother of herod the tetrarch and saul. and as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy spirit said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them. then when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away. so they being sent forth by the holy spirit went down to seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus. and when they were at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john as their attendant. and when they had gone through the whole island unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was bar jesus who was with the proconsul sergius paulus a man of understanding. the same called unto him barnabas and saul and sought to hear the word of god.  but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. but saul who is also [called] paul filled with the holy spirit fastened his eyes on him and said o full of all guile and all villany thou son of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season. and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. then the proconsul when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the teaching of the lord. now paul and his company set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia and john departed from them and returned to jerusalem. but they passing through from perga came to antioch of pisidia and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down. and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on.  and paul stood up and beckoning with the hand said men of israel and ye that fear god hearken the god of this people israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of egypt and with a high arm led he them forth out of it. and for about the time of forty years as a nursingfather bare he them in the wilderness. and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave [them] their land for an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years and after these things he gave [them] judges until samuel the prophet. and afterward they asked for a king and god gave unto them saul the son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin for the space of forty years. and when he had removed him he raised up david to be their king to whom also he bare witness and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after my heart who shall do all my will. of this mans seed hath god according to promise brought unto israel a saviour jesus when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel.  and as john was fulfilling his course he said what suppose ye that i am i am not [he]. but behold there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet i am not worthy to unloose. brethren children of the stock of abraham and those among you that fear god to us is the word of this salvation sent forth. for they that dwell in jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath fulfilled [them] by condemning [him]. and though they found no cause of death [in him] yet asked they of pilate that he should be slain. and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. but god raised him from the dead and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are now his witnesses unto the people. and we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers that god hath fulfilled the same unto our children in that he raised up jesus as also it is written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee.  and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he hath spoken on this wise i will give you the holy and sure [blessings] of david. because he saith also in another [psalm] thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption. for david after he had in his own generation served the counsel of god fell asleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption but he whom god raised up saw no corruption. be it known unto you therefore brethren that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses. beware therefore lest that come upon [you] which is spoken in the prophets behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe if one declare it unto you. and as they went out they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.  now when the synagogue broke up many of the jews and of the devout proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them urged them to continue in the grace of god. and the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of god. but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things which were spoken by paul and blasphemed. and paul and barnabas spake out boldly and said it was necessary that the word of god should first be spoken to you. seeing ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life lo we turn to the gentiles. for so hath the lord commanded us [saying] i have set thee for a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth. and as the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of god and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. and the word of the lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.  but the jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate and the chief men of the city and stirred up a persecution against paul and barnabas and cast them out of their borders. but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium. and the disciples were filled with joy with the holy spirit. and it came to pass in iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of jews and of greeks believed. but the jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the gentiles and made them evil affected against the brethren. long time therefore they tarried [there] speaking boldly in the lord who bare witness unto the word of his grace granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles. and when there was made an onset both of the gentiles and of the jews with their rulers to treat them shamefully and to stone them they became aware of it and fled unto the cities of lycaonia lystra and derbe and the region round about  and there they preached the gospel. and at lystra there sat a certain man impotent in his feet a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked. the same heard paul speaking who fastening eyes upon him and seeing that he had faith to be made whole said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet. and he leaped up and walked. and when the multitude saw what paul had done they lifted up their voice saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercury because he was the chief speaker. and the priest of jupiter whose [temple] was before the city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. but when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they rent their garments and sprang forth among the multitude crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and bring you good tidings that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that in them is  who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. and yet he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons filling your hearts with food and gladness. and with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them. but there came jews thither from antioch and iconium and having persuaded the multitudes they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead. but as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and entered into the city and on the morrow he went forth with barnabas to derbe. and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples they returned to lystra and to iconium and to antioch confirming the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of god. and when they had appointed for them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they had believed.  and they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia. and when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia and thence they sailed to antioch from whence they had been committed to the grace of god for the work which they had fulfilled. and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all things that god had done with them and that he had opened a door of faith unto the gentiles. and they tarried no little time with the disciples. and certain men came down from judaea and taught the brethren [saying] except ye be circumcised after the custom of moses ye cannot be saved. and when paul and barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them [the brethren] appointed that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. they therefore being brought on their way by the church passed through both phoenicia and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.  and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders and they rehearsed all things that god had done with them. but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees who believed saying it is needful to circumcise them and to charge them to keep the law of moses. and the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter. and when there had been much questioning peter rose up and said unto them brethren ye know that a good while ago god made choice among you that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. and god who knoweth the heart bare them witness giving them the holy spirit even as he did unto us and he made no distinction between us and them cleansing their hearts by faith. now therefore why make ye trial of god that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear but we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the lord jesus in like manner as they.  and all the multitude kept silence and they hearkened unto barnabas and paul rehearsing what signs and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles through them. and after they had held their peace james answered saying brethren hearken unto me symeon hath rehearsed how first god visited the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name. and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after these things i will return and i will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up that the residue of men may seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who maketh these things known from of old. wherefore my judgment is that we trouble not them that from among the gentiles turn to god but that we write unto them that they abstain from the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood. for moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath.  then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men out of their company and send them to antioch with paul and barnabas [namely] judas called barsabbas and silas chief men among the brethren and they wrote [thus] by them the apostles and the elders brethren unto the brethren who are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia greeting forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls to whom we gave no commandment it seemed good unto us having come to one accord to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ. we have sent therefore judas and silas who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. for it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things  that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves it shall be well with you. fare ye well. so they when they were dismissed came down to antioch and having gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle. and when they had read it they rejoiced for the consolation. and judas and silas being themselves also prophets exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them. and after they had spent some time [there] they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth. [but it seemed good unto silas to abide there.] but paul and barnabas tarried in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also. and after some days paul said unto barnabas let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the lord [and see] how they fare. and barnabas was minded to take with them john also who was called mark. but paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work.  and there arose a sharp contention so that they parted asunder one from the other and barnabas took mark with him and sailed away unto cyprus but paul choose silas and went forth being commended by the brethren to the grace of the lord. and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches. and he came also to derbe and to lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timothy the son of a jewess that believed but his father was a greek. the same was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium. him would paul have to go forth with him and he took and circumcised him because of the jews that were in those parts for they all knew that his father was a greek. and as they went on their way through the cities they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at jerusalem. so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily. and they went through the region of phrygia and galatia having been forbidden of the holy spirit to speak the word in asia  and when they were come over against mysia they assayed to go into bithynia and the spirit of jesus suffered them not and passing by mysia they came down to troas. and a vision appeared to paul in the night there was a man of macedonia standing beseeching him and saying come over into macedonia and help us.  and when he had seen the vision straightway we sought to go forth into macedonia concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel to them. setting sail therefore from troas we made a straight course to samothrace and the day following to neapolis and from thence to philippi which is a city of macedonia the first of the district a [roman] colony and we were in this city tarrying certain days. and on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spake unto the women that were come together. and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira one that worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by paul.  and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide [there]. and she constrained us. and it came to pass as we were going to the place of prayer that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.  the same following after paul and us cried out saying these men are servants of the most high god who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. and this she did for many days. but paul being sore troubled turned and said to the spirit i charge thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her. and it came out that very hour. but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone they laid hold on paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers and when they had brought them unto the magistrates they said these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive or to observe being romans.  and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent their garments off them and commanded to beat them with rods. and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely who having received such a charge cast them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.  but about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns unto god and the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prisonhouse were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed. and the jailor being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open drew his sword and was about to kill himself supposing that the prisoners had escaped. but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here. and he called for lights and sprang in and trembling for fear fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved  and they said believe on the lord jesus and thou shalt be saved thou and thy house. and they spake the word of the lord unto him with all that were in his house. and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his immediately. and he brought them up into his house and set food before them and rejoiced greatly with all his house having believed in god. but when it was day the magistrates sent the sergeants saying let those men go. and the jailor reported the words to paul [saying] the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore come forth and go in peace. but paul said unto them they have beaten us publicly uncondemned men that are romans and have cast us into prison and do they now cast us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and bring us out. and the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans and they came and besought them and when they had brought them out they asked them to go away from the city.  and they went out of the prison and entered into [the house] of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed. now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews and paul as his custom was went in unto them and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures opening and alleging that it behooved the christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead and that this jesus whom [said he] i proclaim unto you is the christ. and some of them were persuaded and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few. but the jews being moved with jealousy took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble and gathering a crowd set the city on an uproar and assaulting the house of jason they sought to bring them forth to the people. and when they found them not they dragged jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also  whom jason hath received and these all act contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king [one] jesus. and they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city when they heard these things. and when they had taken security from jason and the rest they let them go. and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto beroea who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the jews. now these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind examining the scriptures daily whether these things were so. many of them therefore believed also of the greek women of honorable estate and of men not a few. but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was proclaimed of paul at beroea also they came thither likewise stirring up and troubling the multitudes. and then immediately the brethren sent forth paul to go as far as to the sea and silas and timothy abode there still.  but they that conducted paul brought him as far as athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timothy that they should come to him with all speed they departed. now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols. so he reasoned in the synagogue with jews and the devout persons and in the marketplace every day with them that met him. and certain also of the epicurean and stoic philosophers encountered him. and some said what would this babbler say others he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached jesus and the resurrection. and they took hold of him and brought him unto the areopagus saying may we know what this new teaching is which is spoken by thee for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean. now all the athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.  and paul stood in the midst of the areopagus and said ye men of athens in all things i perceive that ye are very religious. for as i passed along and observed the objects of your worship i found also an altar with this inscription to an unknown god. what therefore ye worship in ignorance this i set forth unto you. the god that made the world and all things therein he being lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is he served by mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he himself giveth to all life and breath and all things and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth having determined [their] appointed seasons and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek god if haply they might feel after him and find him though he is not far from each one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain even of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring. being then the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and device of man.  the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead. now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked but others said we will hear thee concerning this yet again. thus paul went out from among them. but certain men clave unto him and believed among whom also was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them. after these things he departed from athens and came to corinth. and he found a certain jew named aquila a man of pontus by race lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had commanded all the jews to depart from rome and he came unto them and because he was of the same trade he abode with them and they wrought for by their trade they were tentmakers.  and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded jews and greeks. but when silas and timothy came down from macedonia paul was constrained by the word testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ. and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook out his raiment and said unto them your blood [be] upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles. and he departed thence and went into the house of a certain man named titus justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue. and crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized. and the lord said unto paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to harm thee for i have much people in this city. and he dwelt [there] a year and six months teaching the word of god among them. but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews with one accord rose up against paul and brought him before the judgmentseat  saying this man persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law. but when paul was about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you but if they are questions about words and names and your own law look to it yourselves i am not minded to be a judge of these matters. and he drove them from the judgmentseat. and they all laid hold on sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat. and gallio cared for none of these things. and paul having tarried after this yet many days took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence for syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchreae for he had a vow. and they came to ephesus and he left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews. and when they asked him to abide a longer time he consented not but taking his leave of them and saying i will return again unto you if god will he set sail from ephesus.  and when he had landed at caesarea he went up and saluted the church and went down to antioch. and having spent some time [there] he departed and went through the region of galatia and phrygia in order establishing all the disciples. now a certain jew named apollos an alexandrian by race an eloquent man came to ephesus and he was mighty in the scriptures. this man had been instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in spirit he spake and taught accurately the things concerning jesus knowing only the baptism of john and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more accurately. and when he was minded to pass over into achaia the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to receive him and when he was come he helped them much that had believed through grace for he powerfully confuted the jews [and that] publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ.  and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper country came to ephesus and found certain disciples and he said unto them did ye receive the holy spirit when ye believed and they [said] unto him nay we did not so much as hear whether the holy spirit was [given]. and he said into what then were ye baptized and they said into johns baptism. and paul said john baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him that is on jesus. and when they heard this they were baptized into the name of the lord jesus. and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy spirit came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied. and they were in all about twelve men. and he entered into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months reasoning and persuading [as to] the things concerning the kingdom of god. but when some were hardened and disobedient speaking evil of the way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples reasoning daily in the school of tyrannus.  and this continued for the space of two years so that all they that dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord both jews and greeks. and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons and the evil spirits went out. but certain also of the strolling jews exorcists took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying i adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth. and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew a chief priest who did this. and the evil spirit answered and said unto them jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and mastered both of them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. and this became known to all both jews and greeks that dwelt at ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified. many also of them that had believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.  and not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. so mightily grew the word of the lord and prevailed. now after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome. and having sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timothy and erastus he himself stayed in asia for a while. and about that time there arose no small stir concerning the way. for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of diana brought no little business unto the craftsmen whom he gathered together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this business we have our wealth. and ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they are no gods that are made with hands  and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess diana be made of no account and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all asia and the world worshippeth. and when they heard this they were filled with wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesus. and the city was filled with the confusion and they rushed with one accord into the theatre having seized gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel. and when paul was minded to enter in unto the people the disciples suffered him not. and certain also of the asiarchs being his friends sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre. some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was in confusion and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. and they brought alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward. and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made a defense unto the people.  but when they perceived that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians. and when the townclerk had quieted the multitude he saith ye men of ephesus what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the ephesians is templekeeper of the great diana and of the [image] which fell down from jupiter seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rash. for ye have brought [hither] these men who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess. if therefore demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any man the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them accuse one another. but if ye seek anything about other matters it shall be settled in the regular assembly. for indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this days riot there being no cause [for it] and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse. and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly.  and after the uproar ceased paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them took leave of them and departed to go into macedonia. and when he had gone through those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece. and when he had spent three months [there] and a plot was laid against him by jews as he was about to set sail for syria he determined to return through macedonia. and there accompanied him as far as asia sopater of beroea [the son] of pyrrhus and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timothy and of asia tychicus and trophimus. but these had gone before and were waiting for us at troas. and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we tarried seven days. and upon the first day of the week when we were gathered together to break bread paul discoursed with them intending to depart on the morrow and prolonged his speech until midnight. and there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.  and there sat in the window a certain young man named eutychus borne down with deep sleep and as paul discoursed yet longer being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said make ye no ado for his life is in him. and when he was gone up and had broken the bread and eaten and had talked with them a long while even till break of day so he departed. and they brought the lad alive and were not a little comforted. but we going before to the ship set sail for assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed intending himself to go by land. and when he met us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene. and sailing from thence we came the following day over against chios and the next day we touched at samos and the day after we came to miletus. for paul had determined to sail past ephesus that he might not have to spend time in asia for he was hastening if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost. and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.  and when they were come to him he said unto them ye yourselves know from the first day that i set foot in asia after what manner i was with you all the time serving the lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears and with trials which befell me by the plots of the jews how i shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and from house to house  testifying both to jews and to greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ. and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy spirit testifieth unto me in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. but i hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself so that i may accomplish my course and the ministry which i received from the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god. and now behold i know that ye all among whom i went about preaching the kingdom shall see my face no more. wherefore i testify unto you this day that i am pure from the blood of all men.  for i shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of god. take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock in which the holy spirit hath made you bishops to feed the church of the lord which he purchased with his own blood. i know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you not sparing the flock and from among your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.  wherefore watch ye remembering that by the space of three years i ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears. and now i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build [you] up and to give [you] the inheritance among all them that are sanctified. i coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel. ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me. in all things i gave you an example that so laboring ye ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus that he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive. and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all.  and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken that they should behold his face no more. and they brought him on his way unto the ship. and when it came to pass that were parted from them and had set sail we came with a straight course unto cos and the next day unto rhodes and from thence unto patara and having found a ship crossing over unto phoenicia we went aboard and set sail.  and when we had come in sight of cyprus leaving it on the left hand we sailed unto syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden. and having found the disciples we tarried there seven days and these said to paul through the spirit that he should not set foot in jerusalem. and when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days we departed and went on our journey and they all with wives and children brought us on our way till we were out of the city and kneeling down on the beach we prayed and bade each other farewell and we went on board the ship but they returned home again.  and when we had finished the voyage from tyre we arrived at ptolemais and we saluted the brethren and abode with them one day. and on the morrow we departed and came unto caesarea and entering into the house of philip the evangelist who was one of the seven we abode with him. now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. and as we tarried there some days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus. and coming to us and taking pauls girdle he bound his own feet and hands and said thus saith the holy spirit so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles. and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem. then paul answered what do ye weeping and breaking my heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus. and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done. and after these days we took up our baggage and went up to jerusalem.  and there went with us also [certain] of the disciples from caesarea bringing [with them] one mnason of cyprus an early disciple with whom we should lodge. and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly. and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present. and when he had saluted them he rehearsed one by one the things which god had wrought among the gentiles through his ministry. and they when they heard it glorified god and they said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands there are among the jews of them that have believed and they are all zealous for the law and they have been informed concerning thee that thou teachest all the jews who are among the gentiles to forsake moses telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs. what is it therefore they will certainly hear that thou art come. do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men that have a vow on them  these take and purify thyself with them and be at charges for them that they may shave their heads and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee but that thou thyself also walkest orderly keeping the law. but as touching the gentiles that have believed we wrote giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification until the offering was offered for every one of them. and when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place and moreover he brought greeks also into the temple and hath defiled this holy place. for they had before seen with him in the city trophimus the ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple.  and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they laid hold on paul and dragged him out of the temple and straightway the doors were shut. and as they were seeking to kill him tidings came up to the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in confusion. and forthwith he took soldiers and centurions and ran down upon them and they when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers left off beating paul. then the chief captain came near and laid hold on him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and inquired who he was and what he had done. and some shouted one thing some another among the crowd and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar he commanded him to be brought into the castle. and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd for the multitude of the people followed after crying out away with him. and as paul was about to be brought into the castle he saith unto the chief captain may i say something unto thee and he said dost thou know greek  art thou not then the egyptian who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins but paul said i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee give me leave to speak unto the people. and when he had given him leave paul standing on the stairs beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew language saying brethren and fathers hear ye the defence which i now make unto you. and when they heard that he spake unto them in the hebrew language they were the more quiet and he saith i am a jew born in tarsus of cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers being zealous for god even as ye all are this day and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and journeyed to damascus to bring them also that were there unto jerusalem in bonds to be punished. and it came to pass that as i made my journey and drew nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest. and they that were with me beheld indeed the light but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus. and one ananias a devout man according to the law well reported of by all the jews that dwelt there  came unto me and standing by me said unto me brother saul receive thy sight. and in that very hour i looked up on him. and he said the god of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear a voice from his mouth. for thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on his name. and it came to pass that when i had returned to jerusalem and while i prayed in the temple i fell into a trance and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me. and i said lord they themselves know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee and when the blood of stephen thy witness was shed i also was standing by and consenting and keeping the garments of them that slew him. and he said unto me depart for i will send thee forth far hence unto the gentiles.  and they gave him audience unto this word and they lifted up their voice and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live. and as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust into the air the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle bidding that he should be examined by scourging that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him. and when they had tied him up with the thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned and when the centurion heard it he went to the chief captain and told him saying what art thou about to do for this man is a roman. and the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman and he said yea. and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this citizenship. and paul said but i am [a roman] born. they then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him.  but on the morrow desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together and brought paul down and set him before them. and paul looking stedfastly on the council said brethren i have lived before god in all good conscience until this day. and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall and sittest thou to judge me according to the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest and paul said i knew not brethren that he was high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people. but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council brethren i am a pharisee a son of pharisees touching the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question.  and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees and the assembly was divided. for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both. and there arose a great clamor and some of the scribes of the pharisees part stood up and strove saying we find no evil in this man and what if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should be torn in pieces by them commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle. and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer for as thou hast testified concerning me at jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome. and when it was day the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul. and they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.  and they came to the chief priests and the elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse to taste nothing until we have killed paul. now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you as though ye would judge of his case more exactly and we before he comes near are ready to slay him. but pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait and he came and entered into the castle and told paul. and paul called unto him one of the centurions and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath something to tell him. so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and saith paul the prisoner called me unto him and asked me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say to thee. and the chief captain took him by the hand and going aside asked him privately what is it that thou hast to tell me and he said the jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down paul tomorrow unto the council as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.  do not thou therefore yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him and now are they ready looking for the promise from thee. so the chief captain let the young man go charging him tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me. and he called unto him two of the centurions and said make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night and [he bade them] provide beasts that they might set paul thereon and bring him safe unto felix the governor. and he wrote a letter after this form claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix greeting. this man was seized by the jews and was about to be slain of them when i came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him having learned that he was a roman. and desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him down unto their council  whom i found to be accused about questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. and when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man i sent him to thee forthwith charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee. so the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris. but on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle and they when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor presented paul also before him. and when he had read it he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia i will hear thee fully said he when thine accusers also are come and he commanded him to be kept in herods palace. and after five days the high priest ananias came down with certain elders and [with] an orator one tertullus and they informed the governor against paul. and when he was called tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation  we accept it in all ways and in all places most excellent felix with all thankfulness. but that i be not further tedious unto thee i entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of insurrections among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes who moreover assayed to profane the temple on whom also we laid hold [and we would have judged him according to our law.] [but the chief captain lysias came and with great violence took him away out of our hands] [commanding his accusers to come before thee.] from whom thou wilt be able by examining him thyself to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. and the jews also joined in the charge affirming that these things were so. and when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak paul answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i cheerfully make my defense seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship at jerusalem  and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd nor in the synagogues nor in the city. neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me. but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call a sect so serve i the god of our fathers believing all things which are according to the law and which are written in the prophets having hope toward god which these also themselves look for that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. herein i also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward god and men always. now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings amidst which they found me purified in the temple with no crowd nor yet with tumult but [there were] certain jews from asia who ought to have been here before thee and to make accusation if they had aught against me. or else let these men themselves say what wrong doing they found when i stood before the council  except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question before you this day. but felix having more exact knowledge concerning the way deferred them saying when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will determine your matter. and he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge and should have indulgence and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. but after certain days felix came with drusilla his wife who was a jewess and sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ jesus. and as he reasoned of righteousness and selfcontrol and the judgment to come felix was terrified and answered go thy way for this time and when i have a convenient season i will call thee unto me. he hoped withal that money would be given him of paul wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him. but when two years were fulfilled felix was succeeded by porcius festus and desiring to gain favor with the jews felix left paul in bonds.  festus therefore having come into the province after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea. and the chief priests and the principal men of the jews informed him against paul and they besought him asking a favor against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying a plot to kill him on the way. howbeit festus answered that paul was kept in charge at caesarea and that he himself was about to depart [thither] shortly. let them therefore saith he that are of power among you go down with me and if there is anything amiss in the man let them accuse him. and when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days he went down unto caesarea and on the morrow he sat on the judgmentseat and commanded paul to be brought.  and when he was come the jews that had come down from jerusalem stood round about him bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove while paul said in his defense neither against the law of the jews nor against the temple nor against caesar have i sinned at all.  but festus desiring to gain favor with the jews answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me but paul said i am standing before caesars judgmentseat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou also very well knowest. if then i am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death i refuse not to die but if none of those things is [true] whereof these accuse me no man can give me up unto them. i appeal unto caesar. then festus when he had conferred with the council answered thou hast appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go. now when certain days were passed agrippa the king and bernice arrived at caesarea and saluted festus.  and as they tarried there many days festus laid pauls case before the king saying there is a certain man left a prisoner by felix about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed [me] asking for sentence against him.  to whom i answered that it is not the custom of the romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him. when therefore they were come together here i made no delay but on the next day sat on the judgmentseat and commanded the man to be brought. concerning whom when the accusers stood up they brought no charge of such evil things as i supposed but had certain questions against him of their own religion and of one jesus who was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive. and i being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things asked whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters. but when paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor i commanded him to be kept till i should send him to caesar.  and agrippa [said] unto festus i also could wish to hear the man myself. to morrow saith he thou shalt hear him.  so on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at the command of festus paul was brought in. and festus saith king agrippa and all men who are here present with us ye behold this man about whom all the multitude of the jews made suit to me both at jerusalem and here crying that he ought not to live any longer. but i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and as he himself appealed to the emperor i determined to send him. of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord. wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee king agrippa that after examination had i may have somewhat to write. for it seemeth to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not withal to signify the charges against him. and agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself. then paul stretched forth his hand and made his defence  i think myself happy king agrippa that i am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof i am accused by the jews especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently. my manner of life then from my youth up which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at jerusalem know all the jews having knowledge of me from the first if they be willing to testify that after the straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee. and now i stand [here] to be judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers unto which [promise] our twelve tribes earnestly serving [god] night and day hope to attain. and concerning this hope i am accused by the jews o king why is it judged incredible with you if god doth raise the dead i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth.  and this i also did in jerusalem and i both shut up many of the saints in prisons having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my vote against them. and punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues i strove to make them blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto foreign cities. whereupon as i journeyed to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests at midday o king i saw on the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them that journeyed with me. and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice saying unto me in the hebrew language saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the goad. and i said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest. but arise and stand upon thy feet for to this end have i appeared unto thee to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me and of the things wherein i will appear unto thee  delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom i send thee to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me. wherefore o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but declared both to them of damascus first and at jerusalem and throughout all the country of judaea and also to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god doing works worthy of repentance. for this cause the jews seized me in the temple and assayed to kill me. having therefore obtained the help that is from god i stand unto this day testifying both to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses did say should come how that the christ must suffer [and] how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the gentiles. and as he thus made his defense festus saith with a loud voice paul thou art mad thy much learning is turning thee mad.  but paul saith i am not mad most excellent festus but speak forth words of truth and soberness. for the king knoweth of these things unto whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him for this hath not been done in a corner. king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest. and agrippa [said] unto paul with but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a christian. and paul [said] i would to god that whether with little or with much not thou only but also all that hear me this day might become such as i am except these bonds. and the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them and when they had withdrawn they spake one to another saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. and agrippa said unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar. and when it was determined that we should sail for italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named julius of the augustan band.  and embarking in a ship of adramyttium which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of asia we put to sea aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us. and the next day we touched at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself. and putting to sea from thence we sailed under the lee of cyprus because the winds were contrary. and when we had sailed across the sea which is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra [a city] of lycia. and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing for italy and he put us therein. and when we had sailed slowly many days and were come with difficulty over against cnidus the wind not further suffering us we sailed under the lee of crete over against salmone and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea. and when much time was spent and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast was now already gone by paul admonished them  and said unto them sirs i perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss not only of the lading and the ship but also of our lives. but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by paul. and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to put to sea from thence if by any means they could reach phoenix and winter [there which is] a haven of crete looking northeast and southeast. and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose they weighed anchor and sailed along crete close in shore. but after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind which is called euraquilo and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind we gave way [to it] and were driven. and running under the lee of a small island called cauda we were able with difficulty to secure the boat and when they had hoisted it up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should be cast upon the syrtis they lowered the gear and so were driven.  and as we labored exceedingly with the storm the next day they began to throw the [the freight] overboard and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship. and when neither sun nor stars shone upon [us] for many days and no small tempest lay on [us] all hope that we should be saved was now taken away. and when they had been long without food then paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have set sail from crete and have gotten this injury and loss. and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of life among you but [only] of the ship. for there stood by me this night an angel of the god whose i am whom also i serve saying fear not paul thou must stand before caesar and lo god hath granted thee all them that sail with thee. wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me. but we must be cast upon a certain island.  but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven to and fro in the [sea of] adria about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country and they sounded and found twenty fathoms and after a little space they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. and fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground they let go four anchors from the stern and wished for the day. and as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved. then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall off. and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take some food saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting having taken nothing. wherefore i beseech you to take some food for this is for your safety for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.  and when he had said this and had taken bread he gave thanks to god in the presence of all and he brake it and began to eat. then were they all of good cheer and themselves also took food. and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship throwing out the wheat into the sea. and when it was day they knew not the land but they perceived a certain bay with a beach and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it. and casting off the anchors they left them in the sea at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders and hoisting up the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. but lighting upon a place where two seas met they ran the vessel aground and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable but the stern began to break up by the violence [of the waves]. and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any [of them] should swim out and escape. but the centurion desiring to save paul stayed them from their purpose and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard and get first to the land  and the rest some on planks and some on [other] things from the ship. and so it came to pass that they all escaped safe to the land. and when we were escaped then we knew that the island was called melita. and the barbarians showed us no common kindness for they kindled a fire and received us all because of the present rain and because of the cold. but when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire a viper came out by reason of the heat and fastened on his hand. and when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand they said one to another no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped from the sea yet justice hath not suffered to live. howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire and took no harm. but they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god.  now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island named publius who received us and entertained us three days courteously. and it was so that the father of publius lay sick of fever and dysentery unto whom paul entered in and prayed and laying his hands on him healed him. and when this was done the rest also that had diseases in the island came and were cured who also honored us with many honors and when we sailed they put on board such things as we needed. and after three months we set sail in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the island whose sign was the twin brothers. and touching at syracuse we tarried there three days. and from thence we made a circuit and arrived at rhegium and after one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli where we found brethren and were entreated to tarry with them seven days and so we came to rome. and from thence the brethren when they heard of us came to meet us as far as the market of appius and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage.  and when we entered into rome paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him. and it came to pass that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the jews and when they were come together he said unto them i brethren though i had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers yet was delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans who when they had examined me desired to set me at liberty because there was no cause of death in me. but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had aught whereof to accuse my nation. for this cause therefore did i entreat you to see and to speak with [me] for because of the hope of israel i am bound with this chain. and they said unto him we neither received letters from judaea concerning thee nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee. but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.  and when they had appointed him a day they came to him into his lodging in great number to whom he expounded [the matter] testifying the kingdom of god and persuading them concerning jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets from morning till evening. and some believed the things which were spoken and some disbelieved. and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy spirit through isaiah the prophet unto your fathers saying go thou unto this people and say by hearing ye shall hear and shall in no wise understand and seeing ye shall see and shall in no wise perceive for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest haply they should perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should turn again and i should heal them. be it known therefore unto you that this salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles they will also hear.  [and when he had said these words the jews departed having much disputing among themselves.] and he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling and received all that went in unto him preaching the kingdom of god and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness none forbidding him. paul a servant of jesus christ called [to be] an apostle separated unto the gospel of god which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son who was born of the seed of david according to the flesh who was declared [to be] the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead [even] jesus christ our lord through whom we received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all the nations for his names sake among whom are ye also called [to be] jesus christs to all that are in rome beloved of god called [to be] saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ.  first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. for god is my witness whom i serve in my spirit in the gospel of his son how unceasingly i make mention of you always in my prayers making request if by any means now at length i may be prospered by the will of god to come unto you. for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that i with you may be comforted in you each of us by the others faith both yours and mine. and i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you and was hindered hitherto that i might have some fruit in you also even as in the rest of the gentiles. i am debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish. so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in rome. for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek.  for therein is revealed a righteousness of god from faith unto faith as it is written but the righteous shall live by faith. for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hinder the truth in unrighteousness because that which is known of god is manifest in them for god manifested it unto them. for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen being perceived through the things that are made [even] his everlasting power and divinity that they may be without excuse because that knowing god they glorified him not as god neither gave thanks but became vain in their reasonings and their senseless heart was darkened. professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible god for the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things. wherefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves  for that they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed for ever. amen. for this cause god gave them up unto vile passions for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working unseemliness and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.  and even as they refused to have god in [their] knowledge god gave them up unto a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting being filled with all unrighteousness wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder strife deceit malignity whisperers backbiters hateful to god insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection unmerciful who knowing the ordinance of god that they that practise such things are worthy of death not only do the same but also consent with them that practise them.  wherefore thou art without excuse o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judges another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest dost practise the same things. and we know that the judgment of god is according to truth against them that practise such things. and reckonest thou this o man who judgest them that practise such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god  or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his works to them that by patience in well doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption eternal life but unto them that are factious and obey not the truth but obey unrighteousness [shall be] wrath and indignation tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil of the jew first and also of the greek but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the greek  for there is no respect of persons with god. for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law these not having the law are the law unto themselves  in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness therewith and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing [them] in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel by jesus christ. but if thou bearest the name of a jew and restest upon the law and gloriest in god and knowest his will and approvest the things that are excellent being instructed out of the law and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them that are in darkness a corrector of the foolish a teacher of babes having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth  thou therefore that teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou rob temples thou who gloriest in the law through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou god for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you even as it is written. for circumcision indeed profiteth if thou be a doer of the law but if thou be a transgressor of the law thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. if therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law for he is not a jew who is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god.  what advantage then hath the jew or what is the profit of circumcision much every way first of all that they were intrusted with the oracles of god. for what if some were without faith shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of god god forbid yea let god be found true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy words and mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment. but if our righteousness commendeth the righteousness of god what shall we say is god unrighteous who visiteth with wrath i speak after the manner of men. god forbid for then how shall god judge the world but if the truth of god through my lie abounded unto his glory why am i also still judged as a sinner and why not as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose condemnation is just. what then are we better than they no in no wise for we before laid to the charge both of jews and greeks that they are all under sin as it is written there is none righteous no not one  there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god they have all turned aside they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not so much as one their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace have they not known there is no fear of god before their eyes. now we know that what things soever the law saith it speaketh to them that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be brought under the judgment of god because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight for through the law [cometh] the knowledge of sin. but now apart from the law a righteousness of god hath been manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ unto all them that believe for there is no distinction  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of god for the showing [i say] of his righteousness at this present season that he might himself be just and the justifier of him that hath faith in jesus. where then is the glorying it is excluded. by what manner of law of works nay but by a law of faith. we reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. or is god [the god] of jews only is he not [the god] of gentiles also yea of gentiles also if so be that god is one and he shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith. do we then make the law of none effect through faith god forbid nay we establish the law. what then shall we say that abraham our forefather hath found according to the flesh for if abraham was justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not toward god.  for what saith the scripture and abraham believed god and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned as of grace but as of debt. but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is reckoned for righteousness. even as david also pronounceth blessing upon the man unto whom god reckoneth righteousness apart from works [saying] blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. blessed is the man to whom the lord will not reckon sin. is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision or upon the uncircumcision also for we say to abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness. how then was it reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision  and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be in uncircumcision that righteousness might be reckoned unto them and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had in uncircumcision. for not through the law was the promise to abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world but through the righteousness of faith. for if they that are of the law are heirs faith is made void and the promise is made of none effect for the law worketh wrath but where there is no law neither is there transgression. for this cause [it is] of faith that [it may be] according to grace to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all  as it is written a father of many nations have i made thee before him whom he believed [even] god who giveth life to the dead and calleth the things that are not as though they were. who in hope believed against hope to the end that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken so shall thy seed be. and without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead he being about a hundred years old and the deadness of sarahs womb yet looking unto the promise of god he wavered not through unbelief but waxed strong through faith giving glory to god and being fully assured that what he had promised he was able also to perform. wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned unto him but for our sake also unto whom it shall be reckoned who believe on him that raised jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered up for our trespasses and was raised for our justification. being therefore justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ  through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and we rejoice in hope of the glory of god. and not only so but we also rejoice in our tribulations knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness and stedfastness approvedness and approvedness hope and hope putteth not to shame because the love of god hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the holy spirit which was given unto us. for while we were yet weak in due season christ died for the ungodly. for scarcely for a righteous man will one die for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die. but god commendeth his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us. much more then being now justified by his blood shall we be saved from the wrath [of god] through him. for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life and not only so but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation.  therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death passed unto all men for that all sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law. nevertheless death reigned from adam until moses even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of adams transgression who is a figure of him that was to come. but not as the trespass so also [is] the free gift. for if by the trespass of the one the many died much more did the grace of god and the gift by the grace of the one man jesus christ abound unto the many. and not as through one that sinned [so] is the gift for the judgment [came] of one unto condemnation but the free gift [came] of many trespasses unto justification. for if by the trespass of the one death reigned through the one much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one [even] jesus christ.  so then as through one trespass [the judgment came] unto all men to condemnation even so through one act of righteousness [the free gift came] unto all men to justification of life. for as through the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous. and the law came in besides that the trespass might abound but where sin abounded grace did abound more exceedingly that as sin reigned in death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through jesus christ our lord. what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid. we who died to sin how shall we any longer live therein or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death that like as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father so we also might walk in newness of life. for if we have become united with [him] in the likeness of his death we shall be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection  knowing this that our old man was crucified with [him] that the body of sin might be done away that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin for he that hath died is justified from sin. but if we died with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death no more hath dominion over him. for the death that he died he died unto sin once but the life that he liveth he liveth unto god. even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin but alive unto god in christ jesus. let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey the lusts thereof neither present your members unto sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness but present yourselves unto god as alive from the dead and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto god. for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under law but under grace. what then shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace god forbid.  know ye not that to whom ye present yourselves [as] servants unto obedience his servants ye are whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but thanks be to god that whereas ye were servants of sin ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered and being made free from sin ye became servants of righteousness. i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye presented your members [as] servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now present your members [as] servants to righteousness unto sanctification. for when ye were servants of sin ye were free in regard of righteousness. what fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death. but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto sanctification and the end eternal life. for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord.  or are ye ignorant brethren for i speak to men who know the law that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth for the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth but if the husband die she is discharged from the law of the husband. so then if while the husband liveth she be joined to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if the husband die she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man. wherefore my brethren ye also were made dead to the law through the body of christ that ye should be joined to another [even] to him who was raised from the dead that we might bring forth fruit unto god. for when we were in the flesh the sinful passions which were through the law wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. but now we have been discharged from the law having died to that wherein we were held so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter.  what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid. howbeit i had not known sin except through the law for i had not known coveting except the law had said thou shalt not covet but sin finding occasion wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting for apart from the law sin [is] dead. and i was alive apart from the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which [was] unto life this i found [to be] unto death for sin finding occasion through the commandment beguiled me and through it slew me. so that the law is holy and the commandment holy and righteous and good. did then that which is good become death unto me god forbid. but sin that it might be shown to be sin by working death to me through that which is good that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful. for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin. for that which i do i know not for not what i would that do i practise but what i hate that i do.  but if what i would not that i do i consent unto the law that it is good. so now it is no more i that do it but sin which dwelleth in me. for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but to do that which is good [is] not. for the good which i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i practise. but if what i would not that i do it is no more i that do it but sin which dwelleth in me. i find then the law that to me who would do good evil is present. for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see a different law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members. wretched man that i am who shall deliver me out of the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord. so then i of myself with the mind indeed serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin. there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus. for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.  for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. for they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. for the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the spirit is life and peace because the mind of the flesh is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be and they that are in the flesh cannot please god. but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwelleth in you. but if any man hath not the spirit of christ he is none of his. and if christ is in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness. but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelleth in you he that raised up christ jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his spirit that dwelleth in you. so then brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh  for if ye live after the flesh ye must die but if by the spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body ye shall live. for as many as are led by the spirit of god these are sons of god. for ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear but ye received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father. the spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with [him] that we may be also glorified with [him]. for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us ward. for the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of god.  for the creation was subjected to vanity not of its own will but by reason of him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of god. for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  and not only so but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for [our] adoption [to wit] the redemption of our body. for in hope were we saved but hope that is seen is not hope for who hopeth for that which he seeth but if we hope for that which we see not [then] do we with patience wait for it. and in like manner the spirit also helpeth our infirmity for we know not how to pray as we ought but the spirit himself maketh intercession for [us] with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] god. and we know that to them that love god all things work together for good [even] to them that are called according to [his] purpose.  for whom he foreknew he also foreordained [to be] conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and whom he foreordained them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified.  what then shall we say to these things if god [is] for us who [is] against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not also with him freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ jesus that died yea rather that was raised from the dead who is at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us. who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword even as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we were accounted as sheep for the slaughter. nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers  nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord. i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience bearing witness with me in the holy spirit  that i have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. for i could wish that i myself were anathema from christ for my brethrens sake my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites whose is the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service [of god] and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom is christ as concerning the flesh who is over all god blessed for ever. amen. but [it is] not as though the word of god hath come to nought. for they are not all israel that are of israel neither because they are abrahams seed are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called. that is it is not the children of the flesh that are children of god but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. for this is a word of promise according to this season will i come and sarah shall have a son. and not only so but rebecca also having conceived by one [even] by our father isaac for [the children] being not yet born neither having done anything good or bad that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth  it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger. even as it is written jacob i loved but esau i hated. what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid. for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion. so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that hath mercy. for the scripture saith unto pharaoh for this very purpose did i raise thee up that i might show in thee my power and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. so then he hath mercy on whom he will and whom he will be hardeneth. thou wilt say then unto me why doth he still find fault for who withstandeth his will nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why didst thou make me thus or hath not the potter a right over the clay from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor  what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he afore prepared unto glory [even] us whom he also called not from the jews only but also from the gentiles as he saith also in hosea i will call that my people which was not my people and her beloved that was not beloved. and it shall be [that] in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called sons of the living god. and isaiah crieth concerning israel if the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea it is the remnant that shall be saved for the lord will execute [his] word upon the earth finishing it and cutting it short. and as isaiah hath said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had become as sodom and had been made like unto gomorrah. what shall we say then that the gentiles who followed not after righteousness attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith  but israel following after a law of righteousness did not arrive at [that] law. wherefore because [they sought it] not by faith but as it were by works. they stumbled at the stone of stumbling even as it is written behold i lay in zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence and he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. brethren my hearts desire and my supplication to god is for them that they may be saved. for i bear them witness that they have a zeal for god but not according to knowledge. for being ignorant of gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of god. for christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth. for moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby. but the righteousness which is of faith saith thus say not in thy heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down or who shall descend into the abyss that is to bring christ up from the dead.  but what saith it the word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth jesus [as] lord and shalt believe in thy heart that god raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame. for there is no distinction between jew and greek for the same [lord] is lord of all and is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved. how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent even as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things but they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. for isaiah saith lord who hath believed our report so belief [cometh] of hearing and hearing by the word of christ.  but i say did they not hear yea verily their sound went out into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world. but i say did israel not know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation with a nation void of understanding will i anger you. and isaiah is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not i became manifest unto them that asked not of me. but as to israel he saith all the day long did i spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. i say then did god cast off his people god forbid. for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin. god did not cast off his people which he foreknew. or know ye not what the scripture saith of elijah how he pleadeth with god against israel lord they have killed thy prophets they have digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life. but what saith the answer of god unto him i have left for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to baal. even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  but if it is by grace it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace. what then that which israel seeketh for that he obtained not but the election obtained it and the rest were hardened according as it is written god gave them a spirit of stupor eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this very day. and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow thou down their back always. i say then did they stumble that they might fall god forbid but by their fall salvation [is come] unto the gentiles to provoke them to jealousy. now if their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness but i speak to you that are gentiles. inasmuch then as i am an apostle of gentiles i glorify my ministry if by any means i may provoke to jealousy [them that are] my flesh and may save some of them. for if the casting away of them [is] the reconciling of the world what [shall] the receiving [of them be] but life from the dead  and if the firstfruit is holy so is the lump and if the root is holy so are the branches. but if some of the branches were broken off and thou being a wild olive wast grafted in among them and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree glory not over the branches but if thou gloriest it is not thou that bearest the root but the root thee. thou wilt say then branches were broken off that i might be grafted in. well by their unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by thy faith. be not highminded but fear for if god spared not the natural branches neither will he spare thee. behold then the goodness and severity of god toward them that fell severity but toward thee gods goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. and they also if they continue not in their unbelief shall be grafted in for god is able to graft them in again. for if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which are the natural [branches] be grafted into their own olive tree  for i would not brethren have you ignorant of this mystery lest ye be wise in your own conceits that a hardening in part hath befallen israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved even as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer he shall turn away ungodliness from jacob and this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins. as touching the gospel they are enemies for your sake but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sake. for the gifts and the calling of god are not repented of. for as ye in time past were disobedient to god but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience even so have these also now been disobedient that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy. for god hath shut up all unto disobedience that he might have mercy upon all. o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past tracing out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor  or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and unto him are all things. to him [be] the glory for ever. amen. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god [which is] your spiritual service. and be not fashioned according to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god. for i say through the grace that was given me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think as to think soberly according as god hath dealt to each man a measure of faith. for even as we have many members in one body and all the members have not the same office so we who are many are one body in christ and severally members one of another. and having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us whether prophecy [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of our faith or ministry [let us give ourselves] to our ministry or he that teacheth to his teaching  or he that exhorteth to his exhorting he that giveth [let him do it] with liberality he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness. let love be without hypocrisy. abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good. in love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another in honor preferring one another in diligence not slothful fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing stedfastly in prayer communicating to the necessities of the saints given to hospitality. bless them that persecute you bless and curse not. rejoice with them that rejoice weep with them that weep. be of the same mind one toward another. set not your mind on high things but condescend to things that are lowly. be not wise in your own conceits. render to no man evil for evil. take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men. if it be possible as much as in you lieth be at peace with all men. avenge not yourselves beloved but give place unto the wrath [of god] for it is written vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord.  but if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him to drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good. let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers for there is no power but of god and the [powers] that be are ordained of god. therefore he that resisteth the power withstandeth the ordinance of god and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment. for rulers are not a terror to the good work but to the evil. and wouldest thou have no fear of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise from the same for he is a minister of god to thee for good. but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is a minister of god an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil. wherefore [ye] must needs be in subjection not only because of the wrath but also for conscience sake. for this cause ye pay tribute also for they are ministers of gods service attending continually upon this very thing. render to all their dues tribute to whom tribute [is due] custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor.  owe no man anything save to love one another for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law. for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is summed up in this word namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. love worketh no ill to his neighbor love therefore is the fulfilment of the law. and this knowing the season that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep for now is salvation nearer to us than when we [first] believed. the night is far spent and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. let us walk becomingly as in the day not in revelling and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and jealousy. but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof]. but him that is weak in faith receive ye [yet] not for decision of scruples. one man hath faith to eat all things but he that is weak eateth herbs.  let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him. who art thou that judgest the servant of another to his own lord he standeth or falleth. yea he shall be made to stand for the lord hath power to make him stand. one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day [alike]. let each man be fully assured in his own mind. he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that eateth eateth unto the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not unto the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks. for none of us liveth to himself and none dieth to himself. for whether we live we live unto the lord or whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords. for to this end christ died and lived [again] that he might be lord of both the dead and the living. but thou why dost thou judge thy brother or thou again why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgmentseat of god.  for it is written as i live saith the lord to me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to god. so then each one of us shall give account of himself to god. let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge ye this rather that no man put a stumblingblock in his brothers way or an occasion of falling. i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean of itself save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean. for if because of meat thy brother is grieved thou walkest no longer in love. destroy not with thy meat him for whom christ died. let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit. for he that herein serveth christ is wellpleasing to god and approved of men. so then let us follow after things which make for peace and things whereby we may edify one another. overthrow not for meats sake the work of god. all things indeed are clean howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. it is good not to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor [to do anything] whereby thy brother stumbleth.  the faith which thou hast have thou to thyself before god. happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth. but he that doubteth is condemned if he eat because [he eateth] not of faith and whatsoever is not of faith is sin. now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves. let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good unto edifying. for christ also pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me. for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope. now the god of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to christ jesus that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ. wherefore receive ye one another even as christ also received you to the glory of god. for i say that christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god that he might confirm the promises [given] unto the fathers  and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is written therefore will i give praise unto thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name. and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people. and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and let all the peoples praise him. and again isaiah saith there shall be the root of jesse and he that ariseth to rule over the gentiles on him shall the gentiles hope. now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope in the power of the holy spirit.  and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another. but i write the more boldly unto you in some measure as putting you again in remembrance because of the grace that was given me of god that i should be a minister of christ jesus unto the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be made acceptable being sanctified by the holy spirit. i have therefore my glorifying in christ jesus in things pertaining to god.  for i will not dare to speak of any things save those which christ wrought through me for the obedience of the gentiles by word and deed in the power of signs and wonders in the power of the holy spirit so that from jerusalem and round about even unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ yea making it my aim so to preach the gospel not where christ was [already] named that i might not build upon another mans foundation but as it is written they shall see to whom no tidings of him came and they who have not heard shall understand. wherefore also i was hindered these many times from coming to you  but now having no more any place in these regions and having these many years a longing to come unto you whensoever i go unto spain for i hope to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first in some measure i shall have been satisfied with your company but now i [say] i go unto jerusalem ministering unto the saints.  for it hath been the good pleasure of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at jerusalem. yea it hath been their good pleasure and their debtors they are. for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things they owe it [to them] also to minister unto them in carnal things. when therefore i have accomplished this and have sealed to them this fruit i will go on by you unto spain. and i know that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of christ. now i beseech you brethren by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me that i may be delivered from them that are disobedient in judaea and [that] my ministration which [i have] for jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints  that i may come unto you in joy through the will of god and together with you find rest. now the god of peace be with you all. amen. i commend unto you phoebe our sister who is a servant of the church that is at cenchreae  that ye receive her in the lord worthily of the saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you for she herself also hath been a helper of many and of mine own self. salute prisca and aquila my fellow workers in christ jesus who for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles and [salute] the church that is in their house. salute epaenetus my beloved who is the firstfruits of asia unto christ. salute mary who bestowed much labor on you. salute andronicus and junias my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners who are of note among the apostles who also have been in christ before me. salute ampliatus my beloved in the lord. salute urbanus our fellowworker in christ and stachys my beloved. salute apelles the approved in christ. salute them that are of the [household] of aristobulus. salute herodion my kinsman. salute them of the [household] of narcissus that are in the lord. salute tryphaena and tryphosa who labor in the lord. salute persis the beloved who labored much in the lord. salute rufus the chosen in the lord and his mother and mine.  salute asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brethren that are with them. salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints that are with them. salute one another with a holy kiss. all the churches of christ salute you. now i beseech you brethren mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling contrary to the doctrine which ye learned and turn away from them. for they that are such serve not our lord christ but their own belly and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent. for your obedience is come abroad unto all men. i rejoice therefore over you but i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple unto that which is evil. and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly. the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you. timothy my fellowworker saluteth you and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen. i tertius who write the epistle salute you in the lord.  gaius my host and of the whole church saluteth you. erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you and quartus the brother. [the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all. amen.] now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal but now is manifested and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the eternal god is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith to the only wise god through jesus christ to whom be the glory for ever. amen. paul called [to be] an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth [even] them that are sanctified in christ jesus called [to be] saints with all that call upon the name of our lord jesus christ in every place their [lord] and ours grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. i thank my god always concerning you for the grace of god which was given you in christ jesus  that in everything ye were enriched in him in all utterance and all knowledge even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the revelation of our lord jesus christ who shall also confirm you unto the end [that ye be] unreproveable in the day of our lord jesus christ. god is faithful through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord. now i beseech you brethren through the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you but [that] ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment. for it hath been signified unto me concerning you my brethren by them [that are of the household] of chloe that there are contentions among you. now this i mean that each one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ. is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized into the name of paul i thank god that i baptized none of you save crispus and gaius lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.  and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other. for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not in wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made void. for the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us who are saved it is the power of god. for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning will i bring to nought. where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of the world for seeing that in the wisdom of god the world through its wisdom knew not god it was gods good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe. seeing that jews ask for signs and greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto jews a stumblingblock and unto gentiles foolishness but unto them that are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god. because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men.  for behold your calling brethren that not many wise after the flesh not many mighty not many noble [are called] but god chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame them that are wise and god chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong and the base things of the world and the things that are despised did god choose [yea] and the things that are not that he might bring to nought the things that are that no flesh should glory before god. but of him are ye in christ jesus who was made unto us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord. and i brethren when i came unto you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of god. for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified. and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.  and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god. we speak wisdom however among them that are fullgrown yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nought but we speak gods wisdom in a mystery [even] the [wisdom] that hath been hidden which god foreordained before the worlds unto our glory which none of the rulers of this world hath known for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written things which eye saw not and ear heard not and [which] entered not into the heart of man whatsoever things god prepared for them that love him. but unto us god revealed [them] through the spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god. for who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him even so the things of god none knoweth save the spirit of god.  but we received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is from god that we might know the things that were freely given to us of god. which things also we speak not in words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the spirit teacheth combining spiritual things with spiritual [words]. now the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him and he cannot know them because they are spiritually judged. but he that is spiritual judgeth all things and he himself is judged of no man. for who hath known the mind of the lord that he should instruct him but we have the mind of christ. and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal as unto babes in christ. i fed you with milk not with meat for ye were not yet able [to bear it] nay not even now are ye able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife are ye not carnal and do ye not walk after the manner of men for when one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not men  what then is apollos and what is paul ministers through whom ye believed and each as the lord gave to him. i planted apollos watered but god gave the increase. so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase. now he that planteth and he that watereth are one but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. for we are gods fellowworkers ye are gods husbandry gods building. according to the grace of god which was given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i laid a foundation and another buildeth thereon. but let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ. but if any man buildeth on the foundation gold silver costly stones wood hay stubble each mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it is revealed in fire and the fire itself shall prove each mans work of what sort it is. if any mans work shall abide which he built thereon he shall receive a reward.  if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as through fire. know ye not that ye are a temple of god and [that] the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man destroyeth the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy and such are ye. let no man deceive himself. if any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world let him become a fool that he may become wise. for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god. for it is written he that taketh the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain. wherefore let no one glory in men. for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods. let a man so account of us as of ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god. here moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self.  for i know nothing against myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord. wherefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall each man have his praise from god. now these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and apollos for your sakes that in us ye might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other. for who maketh thee to differ and what hast thou that thou didst not receive but if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it already are ye filled already ye are become rich ye have come to reign without us yea and i would that ye did reign that we also might reign with you. for i think god hath set forth us the apostles last of all as men doomed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world both to angels and men. we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye have glory but we have dishonor.  even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace and we toil working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we endure being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world the offscouring of all things even until now. i write not these things to shame you but to admonish you as my beloved children. for though ye have ten thousand tutors in christ yet [have ye] not many fathers for in christ jesus i begat you through the gospel. i beseech you therefore be ye imitators of me. for this cause have i sent unto you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in christ even as i teach everywhere in every church. now some are puffed up as though i were not coming to you. but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and i will know not the word of them that are puffed up but the power. for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power. what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness  it is actually reported that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not even among the gentiles that one [of you] hath his fathers wife. and ye are puffed up and did not rather mourn that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. for i verily being absent in body but present in spirit have already as though i were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing in the name of our lord jesus ye being gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus to deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus. your glorying is not good. know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out the old leaven that ye may be a new lump even as ye are unleavened. for our passover also hath been sacrificed [even] christ wherefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. i wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators  not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous and extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world but as it is i wrote unto you not to keep company if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one no not to eat. for what have i to do with judging them that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without god judgeth. put away the wicked man from among yourselves. dare any of you having a matter against his neighbor go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world and if the world is judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church  i say [this] to move you to shame. what cannot there be [found] among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren but brother goeth to law with brother and that before unbelievers nay already it is altogether a defect in you that ye have lawsuits one with another. why not rather take wrong why not rather be defrauded nay but ye yourselves do wrong and defraud and that [your] brethren. or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with men nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god. and such were some of you but ye were washed but ye were sanctified but ye were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god. all things are lawful for me but not all things are expedient. all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any.  meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall bring to nought both it and them. but the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body and god both raised the lord and will raise up as through his power. know ye not that your bodies are members of christ shall i then take away the members of christ and make them members of a harlot god forbid. or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body for the twain saith he shall become one flesh. but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit. flee fornication. every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. or know ye not that your body is a temple of the holy spirit which is in you which ye have from god and ye are not your own for ye were bought with a price glorify god therefore in your body. now concerning the things whereof ye wrote it is good for a man not to touch a woman. but because of fornications let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.  let the husband render unto the wife her due and likewise also the wife unto the husband. the wife hath not power over her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body but the wife. defraud ye not one the other except it be by consent for a season that ye may give yourselves unto prayer and may be together again that satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. but this i say by way of concession not of commandment. yet i would that all men were even as i myself. howbeit each man hath his own gift from god one after this manner and another after that. but i say to the unmarried and to widows it is good for them if they abide even as i. but if they have not continency let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn. but unto the married i give charge [yea] not i but the lord that the wife depart not from her husband  but should she depart let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and that the husband leave not his wife.  but to the rest say i not the lord if any brother hath an unbelieving wife and she is content to dwell with him let him not leave her. and the woman that hath an unbelieving husband and he is content to dwell with her let her not leave her husband. for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother else were your children unclean but now are they holy. yet if the unbelieving departeth let him depart the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases] but god hath called us in peace. for how knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o husband whether thou shalt save thy wife only as the lord hath distributed to each man as god hath called each so let him walk. and so ordain i in all the churches. was any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised. hath any been called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised.  circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god.  let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. wast thou called being a bondservant care not for it nay even if thou canst become free use [it] rather. for he that was called in the lord being a bondservant is the lords freedman likewise he that was called being free is christs bondservant. ye were bought with a price become not bondservants of men. brethren let each man wherein he was called therein abide with god. now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord but i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be trustworthy. i think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us [namely] that it is good for a man to be as he is. art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed. art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife. but shouldest thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned. yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh and i would spare you. but this i say brethren the time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none  and those that weep as though they wept not and those that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and those that buy as though they possessed not and those that use the world as not using it to the full for the fashion of this world passeth away. but i would have you to be free from cares. he that is unmarried is careful for the things of the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married is careful for the things of the world how he may please his wife and is divided. [so] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married is careful for the things of the world how she may please her husband. and this i say for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is seemly and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction. but if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter] if she be past the flower of her age and if need so requireth let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry.  but he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power as touching in his own heart to keep his own virgin [daughter] shall do well. so then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better. a wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth but if the husband be dead she is free to be married to whom she will only in the lord. but she is happier if she abide as she is after my judgment and i think that i also have the spirit of god. now concerning things sacrificed to idols we know that we all have knowledge. knowledge puffeth up but love edifieth. if any man thinketh that he knoweth anything he knoweth not yet as he ought to know but if any man loveth god the same is known by him. concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols we know that no idol is [anything] in the world and that there is no god but one. for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or on earth as there are gods many and lords many  yet to us there is one god the father of whom are all things and we unto him and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and we through him. howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge but some being used until now to the idol eat as [of] a thing sacrificed to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled. but food will not commend us to god neither if we eat not are we the worse nor if we eat are we the better. but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. for if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idols temple will not his conscience if he is weak be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols for through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth the brother for whose sake christ died. and thus sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak ye sin against christ. wherefore if meat causeth my brother to stumble i will eat no flesh for evermore that i cause not my brother to stumble. am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are not ye my work in the lord  if to others i am not an apostle yet at least i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord. my defence to them that examine me is this. have we no right to eat and to drink have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer even as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the lord and cephas or i only and barnabas have we not a right to forbear working what soldier ever serveth at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock do i speak these things after the manner of men or saith not the law also the same for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. is it for the oxen that god careth or saith he it assuredly for our sake yea for our sake it was written because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope and he that thresheth [to thresh] in hope of partaking. if we sowed unto you spiritual things is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things  if others partake of [this] right over you do not we yet more nevertheless we did not use this right but we bear all things that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of christ. know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple [and] they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar even so did the lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. but i have used none of these things and i write not these things that it may be so done in my case for [it were] good for me rather to die than that any man should make my glorifying void. for if i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me for woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel. for if i do this of mine own will i have a reward but if not of mine own will i have a stewardship intrusted to me. what then is my reward that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel without charge so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. for though i was free from all [men] i brought myself under bondage to all that i might gain the more.  and to the jews i became as a jew that i might gain jews to them that are under the law as under the law not being myself under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law not being without law to god but under law to christ that i might gain them that are without law. to the weak i became weak that i might gain the weak i am become all things to all men that i may by all means save some. and i do all things for the gospels sake that i may be a joint partaker thereof. know ye not that they that run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize even so run that ye may attain. and every man that striveth in the games exerciseth selfcontrol in all things. now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible. i therefore so run as not uncertainly so fight i as not beating the air but i buffet my body and bring it into bondage lest by any means after that i have preached to others i myself should be rejected. for i would not brethren have you ignorant that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea  and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual food and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ. howbeit with most of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness. now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. neither let us make trial of the lord as some of them made trial and perished by the serpents. neither murmur ye as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer. now these things happened unto them by way of example and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the ages are come. wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.  there hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation make also the way of escape that ye may be able to endure it. wherefore my beloved flee from idolatry. i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say. the cup of blessing which we bless is it not a communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not a communion of the body of christ seeing that we who are many are one bread one body for we are all partake of the one bread. behold israel after the flesh have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar what say i then that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything but [i say] that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to god and i would not that ye should have communion with demons. ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons ye cannot partake of the table of the lord and of the table of demons. or do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he  all things are lawful but not all things are expedient. all things are lawful but not all things edify. let no man seek his own but [each] his neighbors [good]. whatsoever is sold in the shambles eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof. if one of them that believe not biddeth you [to a feast] and ye are disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake. but if any man say unto you this hath been offered in sacrifice eat not for his sake that showed it and for conscience sake conscience i say not thine own but the others for why is my liberty judged by another conscience if i partake with thankfulness why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god. give no occasions of stumbling either to jews or to greeks or to the church of god even as i also please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the [profit] of the many that they may be saved. be ye imitators of me even as i also am of christ.  now i praise you that ye remember me in all things and hold fast the traditions even as i delivered them to you. but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god. every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head. but every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. for if a woman is not veiled let her also be shorn but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be veiled. for a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man. for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man for neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have [a sign of] authority on her head because of the angels. nevertheless neither is the woman without the man nor the man without the woman in the lord.  for as the woman is of the man so is the man also by the woman but all things are of god. judge ye in yourselves is it seemly that a woman pray unto god unveiled doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a dishonor to him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering. but if any man seemeth to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god. but in giving you this charge i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that divisions exist among you and i partly believe it. for there must be also factions among you that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. when therefore ye assemble yourselves together it is not possible to eat the lords supper for in your eating each one taketh before [other] his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken.  what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and put them to shame that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not. for i received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said this is my body which is for you this do in remembrance of me. in like manner also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood this do as often as ye drink [it] in remembrance of me. for as often as ye eat this bread and drink the cup ye proclaim the lords death till he come. wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord. but let a man prove himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. for he that eateth and drinketh eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself if he discern not the body. for this cause many among you are weak and sickly and not a few sleep.  but if we discerned ourselves we should not be judged. but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we may not be condemned with the world. wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat wait one for another. if any man is hungry let him eat at home that your coming together be not unto judgment. and the rest will i set in order whensoever i come. now concerning spiritual [gifts] brethren i would not have you ignorant. ye know that when ye were gentiles [ye were] led away unto those dumb idols howsoever ye might led. wherefore i make known unto you that no man speaking in the spirit of god saith jesus is anathema and no man can say jesus is lord but in the holy spirit. now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. and there are diversities of ministrations and the same lord. and there are diversities of workings but the same god who worketh all things in all. but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit to profit withal. for to one is given through the spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge according to the same spirit  to another faith in the same spirit and to another gifts of healings in the one spirit and to another workings of miracles and to another prophecy and to another discernings of spirits to another [divers] kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh the one and the same spirit dividing to each one severally even as he will. for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of the body being many are one body so also is christ. for in one spirit were we all baptized into one body whether jews or greeks whether bond or free and were all made to drink of one spirit. for the body is not one member but many. if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body it is not therefore not of the body. and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body it is not therefore not of the body. if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members each one of them in the body even as it pleased him.  and if they were all one member where were the body but now they are many members but one body. and the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of thee or again the head to the feet i have no need of you. nay much rather those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those [parts] of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness whereas our comely [parts] have no need but god tempered the body together giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but [that] the members should have the same care one for another. and whether one member suffereth all the members suffer with it or [one] member is honored all the members rejoice with it. now ye are the body of christ and severally members thereof. and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondly prophets thirdly teachers then miracles then gifts of healings helps governments [divers] kinds of tongues.  are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all [workers of] miracles have all gifts of healings do all speak with tongues do all interpret but desire earnestly the greater gifts. and moreover a most excellent way show i unto you. if i speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. and if i have [the gift of] prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love i am nothing. and if i bestow all my goods to feed [the poor] and if i give my body to be burned but have not love it profiteth me nothing. love suffereth long [and] is kind love envieth not love vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not its own is not provoked taketh not account of evil rejoiceth not in unrighteousness but rejoiceth with the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things.  love never faileth but whether [there be] prophecies they shall be done away whether [there be] tongues they shall cease whether [there be] knowledge it shall be done away. for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away. when i was a child i spake as a child i felt as a child i thought as a child now that i am become a man i have put away childish things. for now we see in a mirror darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know fully even as also i was fully known. but now abideth faith hope love these three and the greatest of these is love. follow after love yet desire earnestly spiritual [gifts] but rather that ye may prophesy. for he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification and exhortation and consolation. he that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.  now i would have you all speak with tongues but rather that ye should prophesy and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying. but now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you unless i speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophesying or of teaching  even things without life giving a voice whether pipe or harp if they give not a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain voice who shall prepare himself for war so also ye unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye will be speaking into the air. there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and no [kind] is without signification. if then i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me. so also ye since ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts] seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church. wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.  for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful. what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also. else if thou bless with the spirit how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest  for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified. i thank god i speak with tongues more than you all howbeit in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that i might instruct others also than ten thousand words in a tongue. brethren be not children in mind yet in malice be ye babes but in mind be men. in the law it is written by men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will i speak unto this people and not even thus will they hear me saith the lord. wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to the unbelieving but prophesying [is for a sign] not to the unbelieving but to them that believe.  if therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving will they not say that ye are mad but if all prophesy and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned he is reproved by all he is judged by all the secrets of his heart are made manifest and so he will fall down on his face and worship god declaring that god is among you indeed.  what is it then brethren when ye come together each one hath a psalm hath a teaching hath a revelation hath a tongue hath an interpretation. let all things be done unto edifying. if any man speaketh in a tongue [let it be] by two or at the most three and [that] in turn and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god. and let the prophets speak [by] two or three and let the others discern. but if a revelation be made to another sitting by let the first keep silence. for ye all can prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be exhorted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets  for god is not [a god] of confusion but of peace. as in all the churches of the saints let the women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but let them be in subjection as also saith the law. and if they would learn anything let them ask their own husbands at home for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church. what was it from you that the word of god went forth or came it unto you alone if any man thinketh himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him take knowledge of the things which i write unto you that they are the commandment of the lord. but if any man is ignorant let him be ignorant. wherefore my brethren desire earnestly to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues. but let all things be done decently and in order. now i make known unto you brethren the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye received wherein also ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye hold fast the word which i preached unto you except ye believed in vain. for i delivered unto you first of all that which also i received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures  and that he was buried and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain until now but some are fallen asleep then he appeared to james then to all the apostles and last of all as to the [child] untimely born he appeared to me also. for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god. but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me. whether then [it be] i or they so we preach and so ye believed. now if christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there is no resurrection of the dead neither hath christ been raised and if christ hath not been raised then is our preaching vain your faith also is vain.  yea we are found false witnesses of god because we witnessed of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead are not raised. for if the dead are not raised neither hath christ been raised and if christ hath not been raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins. then they also that are fallen asleep in christ have perished. if we have only hoped in christ in this life we are of all men most pitiable. but now hath christ been raised from the dead the firstfruits of them that are asleep. for since by man [came] death by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead. for as in adam all die so also in christ shall all be made alive. but each in his own order christ the firstfruits then they that are christs at his coming. then [cometh] the end when he shall deliver up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power. for he must reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet. the last enemy that shall be abolished is death.  for he put all things in subjection under his feet. but when he saith all things are put in subjection it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. and when all things have been subjected unto him then shall the son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him that god may be all in all. else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead if the dead are not raised at all why then are they baptized for them why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour i protest by that glorifying in you brethren which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily. if after the manner of men i fought with beasts at ephesus what doth it profit me if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die. be not deceived evil companionships corrupt good morals. awake to soberness righteously and sin not for some have no knowledge of god i speak [this] to move you to shame. but some one will say how are the dead raised and with what manner of body do they come thou foolish one that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die  and that which thou sowest thou sowest not the body that shall be but a bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other kind but god giveth it a body even as it pleased him and to each seed a body of its own. all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one [flesh] of men and another flesh of beasts and another flesh of birds and another of fishes. there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another. there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory. so also is the resurrection of the dead. it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body. if there is a natural body there is also a spiritual [body]. so also it is written the first man adam became a living soul. the last adam [became] a lifegiving spirit. howbeit that is not first which is spiritual but that which is natural then that which is spiritual.  the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is of heaven. as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly. and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. behold i tell you a mystery we all shall not sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed. for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality. but when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory. o death where is thy victory o death where is thy sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to god who giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ.  wherefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the lord. now concerning the collection for the saints as i gave order to the churches of galatia so also do ye. upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store as he may prosper that no collections be made when i come. and when i arrive whomsoever ye shall approve them will i send with letters to carry your bounty unto jerusalem and if it be meet for me to go also they shall go with me. but i will come unto you when i shall have passed through macedonia for i pass through macedonia but with you it may be that i shall abide or even winter that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever i go. for i do not wish to see you now by the way for i hope to tarry a while with you if the lord permit. but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries. now if timothy come see that he be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do  let no man therefore despise him. but set him forward on his journey in peace that he may come unto me for i expect him with the brethren. but as touching apollos the brother i besought him much to come unto you with the brethren and it was not all [his] will to come now but he will come when he shall have opportunity. watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong. let all that ye do be done in love. now i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints that ye also be in subjection unto such and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth. and i rejoice at the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they supplied. for they refreshed my spirit and yours acknowledge ye therefore them that are such. the churches of asia salute you. aquila and prisca salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house. all the brethren salute you. salute one another with a holy kiss. the salutation of me paul with mine own hand.  if any man loveth not the lord let him be anathema. maranatha. the grace of the lord jesus christ be with you. my love be with you all in christ jesus. amen. paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints that are in the whole of achaia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. blessed [be] the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and god of all comfort who comforteth us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god. for as the sufferings of christ abound unto us even so our comfort also aboundeth through christ. but whether we are afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation or whether we are comforted it is for your comfort which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer and our hope for you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so also are ye of the comfort.  for we would not have you ignorant brethren concerning our affliction which befell [us] in asia that we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power insomuch that we despaired even of life yea we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god who raiseth the dead who delivered us out of so great a death and will deliver on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf. for our glorifying is this the testimony of our conscience that in holiness and sincerity of god not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of god we behaved ourselves in the world and more abundantly to youward. for we write no other things unto you than what ye read or even acknowledge and i hope ye will acknowledge unto the end as also ye did acknowledge us in part that we are your glorying even as ye also are ours in the day of our lord jesus.  and in this confidence i was minded to come first unto you that ye might have a second benefit and by you to pass into macedonia and again from macedonia to come unto you and of you to be set forward on my journey unto judaea. when i therefore was thus minded did i show fickleness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay but as god is faithful our word toward you is not yea and nay. for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us [even] by me and silvanus and timothy was not yea and nay but in him is yea. for how many soever be the promises of god in him is the yea wherefore also through him is the amen unto the glory of god through us. now he that establisheth us with you in christ and anointed us is god who also sealed us and gave [us] the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. but i call god for a witness upon my soul that to spare you i forbare to come unto corinth. not that we have lordship over your faith but are helpers of your joy for in faith ye stand fast.  but i determined this for myself that i would not come again to you with sorrow. for if i make you sorry who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me and i wrote this very thing lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is [the joy] of you all. for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be made sorry but that ye might know the love that i have more abundantly unto you. but if any hath caused sorrow he hath caused sorrow not to me but in part that i press not too heavily to you all. sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. wherefore i beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him. for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye are obedient in all things.  but to whom ye forgive anything i [forgive] also for what i also have forgiven if i have forgiven anything for your sakes [have i forgiven it] in the presence of christ that no advantage may be gained over us by satan for we are not ignorant of his devices. now when i came to troas for the gospel of christ and when a door was opened unto me in the lord i had no relief for my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went forth into macedonia. but thanks be unto god who always leadeth us in triumph in christ and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. for we are a sweet savor of christ unto god in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one a savor from death unto death to the other a savor from life unto life. and who is sufficient for these things for we are not as the many corrupting the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ. are we beginning again to commend ourselves or need we as do some epistles of commendation to you or from you  ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men being made manifest that ye are an epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh. and such confidence have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves but our sufficiency is from god who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life. but if the ministration of death written [and] engraven on stones came with glory so that the children of israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of moses for the glory of his face which [glory] was passing away how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory for if the ministration of condemnation hath glory much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. for verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect by reason of the glory that surpasseth.  for if that which passeth away [was] with glory much more that which remaineth [is] in glory. having therefore such a hope we use great boldness of speech and [are] not as moses [who] put a veil upon his face that the children of israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away but their minds were hardened for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth it not being revealed [to them] that it is done away in christ. but unto this day whensoever moses is read a veil lieth upon their heart. but whensoever it shall turn to the lord the veil is taken away. now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is [there] is liberty. but we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the lord are transformed into the same image from glory to glory even as from the lord the spirit. therefore seeing we have this ministry even as we obtained mercy we faint not  but we have renounced the hidden things of shame not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god. and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled in them that perish in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving that the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god should not dawn [upon them]. for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus as lord and ourselves as your servants for jesus sake. seeing it is god that said light shall shine out of darkness who shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ. but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of god and not from ourselves [we are] pressed on every side yet not straitened perplexed yet not unto despair pursued yet not forsaken smitten down yet not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of jesus that the life also of jesus may be manifested in our body.  for we who live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. so then death worketh in us but life in you. but having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written i believed and therefore did i speak we also believe and therefore also we speak knowing that he that raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also with jesus and shall present us with you.  for all things [are] for your sakes that the grace being multiplied through the many may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of god. wherefore we faint not but though our outward man is decaying yet our inward man is renewed day by day. for our light affliction which is for the moment worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.  for we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. for verily in this we groan longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. for indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but that we would be clothed upon that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life. now he that wrought us for this very thing is god who gave unto us the earnest of the spirit.  being therefore always of good courage and knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are of good courage i say and are willing rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the lord. wherefore also we make it our aim whether at home or absent to be well pleasing unto him.  for we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of christ that each one may receive the things [done] in the body according to what he hath done whether [it be] good or bad. knowing therefore the fear of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. we are not again commending ourselves unto you but [speak] as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance and not in heart. for whether we are beside ourselves it is unto god or whether we are of sober mind it is unto you. for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that one died for all therefore all died  and he died for all that they that live should no longer live unto themselves but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again. wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh even though we have known christ after the flesh yet now we know [him so] no more. wherefore if any man is in christ [he is] a new creature the old things are passed away behold they are become new.  but all things are of god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not reckoning unto them their trespasses and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. we are ambassadors therefore on behalf of christ as though god were entreating by us we beseech [you] on behalf of christ be ye reconciled to god. him who knew no sin he made [to be] sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of god in him. and working together [with him] we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain for he saith at an acceptable time i hearkened unto thee and in a day of salvation did i succor thee behold now is the acceptable time behold now is the day of salvation giving no occasion of stumbling in anything that our ministration be not blamed but in everything commending ourselves as ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labors in watchings in fastings  in pureness in knowledge in long suffering in kindness in the holy spirit in love unfeigned in the word of truth in the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by glory and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and [yet] true as unknown and [yet] well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and [yet] possessing all things. our mouth is open unto you o corinthians our heart is enlarged. ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own affections. now for a recompense in like kind i speak as unto [my] children be ye also enlarged. be not unequally yoked with unbelievers for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity or what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever  and what agreement hath a temple of god with idols for we are a temple of the living god even as god said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people. wherefore come ye out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch no unclean thing and i will receive you and will be to you a father and ye shall be to me sons and daughters saith the lord almighty. having therefore these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god. open your hearts to us we wronged no man we corrupted no man we took advantage of no man. i say it not to condemn [you] for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together. great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying on your behalf i am filled with comfort i overflow with joy in all our affliction. for even when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no relief but [we were] afflicted on every side without [were] fightings within [were] fears.  nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly [even] god comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you while he told us your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced yet more. for though i made you sorry with my epistle i do not regret it though i did regret [it] for i see that that epistle made you sorry though but for a season i now rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye were made sorry unto repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly sort that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing. for godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation [a repentance] which bringeth no regret but the sorrow of the world worketh death. for behold this selfsame thing that ye were made sorry after a godly sort what earnest care it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what longing yea what zeal yea what avenging in everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.  so although i wrote unto you i [wrote] not for his cause that did the wrong nor for his cause that suffered the wrong but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of god. therefore we have been comforted and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of titus because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all. for if in anything i have gloried to him on your behalf i was not put to shame but as we spake all things to you in truth so our glorying also which i made before titus was found to be truth. and his affection is more abundantly toward you while he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him. i rejoice that in everything i am of good courage concerning you. moreover brethren we make known to you the grace of god which hath been given in the churches of macedonia how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. for according to their power i bear witness yea and beyond their power [they gave] of their own accord  beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints and [this] not as we had hoped but first they gave their own selves to the lord and to us through the will of god. insomuch that we exhorted titus that as he made a beginning before so he would also complete in you this grace also. but as ye abound in everything [in] faith and utterance and knowledge and [in] all earnestness and [in] your love to us [see] that ye abound in this grace also. i speak not by way of commandment but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might become rich. and herein i give [my] judgment for this is expedient for you who were the first to make a beginning a year ago not only to do but also to will. but now complete the doing also that as [there was] the readiness to will so [there may be] the completion also out of your ability.  for if the readiness is there [it is] acceptable according as [a man] hath not according as [he] hath not. for [i say] not [this] that others may be eased [and] ye distressed but by equality your abundance [being a supply] at this present time for their want that their abundance also may become [a supply] for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that [gathered] much had nothing over and he that [gathered] little had no lack. but thanks be to god who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of titus. for he accepted indeed our exhortation but being himself very earnest he went forth unto you of his own accord. and we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel [is spread] through all the churches and not only so but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in [the matter of] this grace which is ministered by us to the glory of the lord and [to show] our readiness avoiding this that any man should blame us in [the matter of] this bounty which is ministered by us for we take thought for things honorable not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men.  and we have sent with them our brother whom we have many times proved earnest in many things but now much more earnest by reason of the great confidence which [he hath] in you. whether [any inquire] about titus [he is] my partner and [my] fellowworker to youward or our brethren [they are] the messengers of the churches [they are] the glory of christ. show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love and of our glorying on your behalf. for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know your readiness of which i glory on your behalf to them of macedonia that achaia hath been prepared for a year past and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them. but i have sent the brethren that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect that even as i said ye may be prepared lest by any means if there come with me any of macedonia and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be put to shame in this confidence.  i thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not of extortion. but this [i say] he that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. [let] each man [do] according as he hath purposed in his heart not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver. and god is able to make all grace abound unto you that ye having always all sufficiency in everything may abound unto every good work as it is written he hath scattered abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness abideth for ever. and he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality which worketh through us thanksgiving to god. for the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto god  seeing that through the proving [of you] by this ministration they glorify god for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of christ and for the liberality of [your] contribution unto them and unto all while they themselves also with supplication on your behalf long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of god in you. thanks be to god for his unspeakable gift. now i paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of christ i who in your presence am lowly among you but being absent am of good courage toward you yea i beseech you that i may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith i count to be bold against some who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but mighty before god to the casting down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of god and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ  and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall be made full. ye look at the things that are before your face. if any man trusteth in himself that he is christs let him consider this again with himself that even as he is christs so also are we. for though i should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority which the lord gave for building you up and not for casting you down i shall not be put to shame that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by my letters. for his letters they say are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account. let such a one reckon this that what we are in word by letters when we are absent such [are we] also in deed when we are present. for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves but they themselves measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves are without understanding.  but we will not glory beyond [our] measure but according to the measure of the province which god apportioned to us as a measure to reach even unto you. for we stretch not ourselves overmuch as though we reached not unto you for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of christ not glorying beyond [our] measure [that is] in other mens labors but having hope that as your faith groweth we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto [further] abundance so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you [and] not to glory in anothers province in regard of things ready to our hand. but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord. for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth. would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness but indeed ye do bear with me. for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i espoused you to one husband that i might present you [as] a pure virgin to christ.  but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve in his craftiness your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward christ. for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we did not preach or [if] ye receive a different spirit which ye did not receive or a different gospel which ye did not accept ye do well to bear with [him]. for i reckon that i am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. but though [i be] rude in speech yet [am i] not in knowledge nay in every way have we made [this] manifest unto you in all things. or did i commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i preached to you the gospel of god for nought i robbed other churches taking wages [of them] that i might minister unto you and when i was present with you and was in want i was not a burden on any man for the brethren when they came from macedonia supplied the measure of my want and in everything i kept myself from being burdensome unto you and [so] will i keep [myself]. as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of achaia.  wherefore because i love you not god knoweth. but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we. for such men are false apostles deceitful workers fashioning themselves into apostles of christ. and no marvel for even satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. it is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works. i say again let no man think me foolish but if [ye do] yet as foolish receive me that i also may glory a little. that which i speak i speak not after the lord but as in foolishness in this confidence of glorying. seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also. for ye bear with the foolish gladly being wise [yourselves]. for ye bear with a man if he bringeth you into bondage if he devoureth you if he taketh you [captive] if he exalteth himself if he smiteth you on the face. i speak by way of disparagement as though we had been weak. yet whereinsoever any is bold i speak in foolishness i am bold also.  are they hebrews so am i. are they israelites so am i. are they the seed of abraham so am i. are they ministers of christ i speak as one beside himself i more in labors more abundantly in prisons more abundantly in stripes above measure in deaths oft. of the jews five times received i forty [stripes] save one. thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day have i been in the deep [in] journeyings often [in] perils of rivers [in] perils of robbers [in] perils from [my] countrymen [in] perils from the gentiles [in] perils in the city [in] perils in the wilderness [in] perils in the sea [in] perils among false brethren [in] labor and travail in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness. besides those things that are without there is that which presseth upon me daily anxiety for all the churches. who is weak and i am not weak who is caused to stumble and i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things that concern my weakness.  the god and father of the lord jesus he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not. in damascus the governor under aretas the king guarded the city of the damascenes in order to take me and through a window was i let down in a basket by the wall and escaped his hands. i must needs glory though it is not expedient but i will come to visions and revelations of the lord. i know a man in christ fourteen years ago whether in the body i know not or whether out of the body i know not god knoweth such a one caught up even to the third heaven. and i know such a man whether in the body or apart from the body i know not god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter. on behalf of such a one will i glory but on mine own behalf i will not glory save in [my] weaknesses. for if i should desire to glory i shall not be foolish for i shall speak the truth but i forbear lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me [to be] or heareth from me.  and by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations that i should not be exalted overmuch there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me that i should not be exalted overmuch. concerning this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me. and he hath said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for [my] power is made perfect in weakness. most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my weaknesses that the power of christ may rest upon me. wherefore i take pleasure in weaknesses in injuries in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong. i am become foolish ye compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing was i behind the very chiefest apostles though i am nothing. truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience by signs and wonders and mighty works. for what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches except [it be] that i myself was not a burden to you forgive me this wrong.  behold this is the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be a burden to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children. and i will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. if i love you more abundantly am i loved the less but be it so i did not myself burden you but being crafty i caught you with guile. did i take advantage of you by any one of them whom i have sent unto you i exhorted titus and i sent the brother with him. did titus take any advantage of you walked we not in the same spirit [walked we] not in the same steps ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. in the sight of god speak we in christ. but all things beloved [are] for your edifying. for i fear lest by any means when i come i should find you not such as i would and should myself be found of you such as ye would not lest by any means [there should be] strife jealousy wraths factions backbitings whisperings swellings tumults  lest again when i come my god should humble me before you and i should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.  this is the third time i am coming to you. at the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word established. i have said beforehand and i do say beforehand as when i was present the second time so now being absent to them that have sinned heretofore and to all the rest that if i come again i will not spare seeing that ye seek a proof of christ that speaketh in me who to youward is not weak but is powerful in you for he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth through the power of god. for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him through the power of god toward you. try your own selves whether ye are in the faith prove your own selves. or know ye not as to your own selves that jesus christ is in you unless indeed ye be reprobate. but i hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.  now we pray to god that ye do no evil not that we may appear approved but that ye may do that which is honorable though we be as reprobate.  for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth. for we rejoice when we are weak and ye are strong this we also pray for even your perfecting. for this cause i write these things while absent that i may not when present deal sharply according to the authority which the lord gave me for building up and not for casting down. finally brethren farewell. be perfected be comforted be of the same mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you. salute one another with a holy kiss. all the saints salute you. the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with you all. paul an apostle not from men neither through man but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren that are with me unto the churches of galatia grace to you and peace from god the father and our lord jesus christ  who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us out of this present evil world according to the will of our god and father to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. amen. i marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of christ unto a different gospel which is not another [gospel] only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ. but though we or an angel from heaven should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you let him be anathema. as we have said before so say i now again if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received let him be anathema. for am i now seeking the favor of men or of god or am i striving to please men if i were still pleasing men i should not be a servant of christ. for i make known to you brethren as touching the gospel which was preached by me that it is not after man. for neither did i receive it from man nor was i taught it but [it came to me] through revelation of jesus christ.  for ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and made havoc of it and i advanced in the jews religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. but when it was the good pleasure of god who separated me [even] from my mothers womb and called me through his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the gentiles straightway i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me but i went away into arabia and again i returned unto damascus. then after three years i went up to jerusalem to visit cephas and tarried with him fifteen days. but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords brother. now touching the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not. then i came unto the regions of syria and cilicia. and i was still unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ  but they only heard say he that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc and they glorified god in me. then after the space of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus also with me. and i went up by revelation and i laid before them the gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately before them who were of repute lest by any means i should be running or had run in vain. but not even titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of the false brethren privily brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place in the way of subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. but from those who were reputed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth not mans person they i say who were of repute imparted nothing to me  but contrariwise when they saw that i had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision even as peter with [the gospel] of the circumcision for he that wrought for peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the gentiles and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me james and cephas and john they who were reputed to be pillars gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the gentiles and they unto the circumcision only [they would] that we should remember the poor which very thing i was also zealous to do. but when cephas came to antioch i resisted him to the face because he stood condemned. for before that certain came from james he ate with the gentiles but when they came he drew back and separated himself fearing them that were of the circumcision. and the rest of the jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.  but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto cephas before [them] all if thou being a jew livest as do the gentiles and not as do the jews how compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews we being jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ even we believed on christ jesus that we might be justified by faith in christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. but if while we sought to be justified in christ we ourselves also were found sinners is christ a minister of sin god forbid. for if i build up again those things which i destroyed i prove myself a transgressor. for i through the law died unto the law that i might live unto god. i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i that live but christ living in me and that [life] which i now live in the flesh i live in faith [the faith] which is in the son of god who loved me and gave himself up for me. i do not make void the grace of god for if righteousness is through the law then christ died for nought.  o foolish galatians who did bewitch you before whose eyes jesus christ was openly set forth crucified this only would i learn from you. received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now perfected in the flesh did ye suffer so many things in vain if it be indeed in vain. he therefore that supplieth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you [doeth he it] by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. know therefore that they that are of faith the same are sons of abraham. and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand unto abraham [saying] in thee shall all the nations be blessed. so then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful abraham. for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.  now that no man is justified by the law before god is evident for the righteous shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but he that doeth them shall live in them. christ redeemed us from the curse of the law having become a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that upon the gentiles might come the blessing of abraham in christ jesus that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a mans covenant yet when it hath been confirmed no one maketh it void or addeth thereto. now to abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ. now this i say a covenant confirmed beforehand by god the law which came four hundred and thirty years after doth not disannul so as to make the promise of none effect. for if the inheritance is of the law it is no more of promise but god hath granted it to abraham by promise.  what then is the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made [and it was] ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one but god is one. is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could make alive verily righteousness would have been of the law. but the scriptures shut up all things under sin that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to them that believe. but before faith came we were kept in ward under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. so that the law is become our tutor [to bring us] unto christ that we might be justified by faith. but now faith that is come we are no longer under a tutor. for ye are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus. for as many of you as were baptized into christ did put on christ. there can be neither jew nor greek there can be neither bond nor free there can be no male and female for ye all are one [man] in christ jesus.  and if ye are christs then are ye abrahams seed heirs according to promise. but i say that so long as the heir is a child he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father. so we also when we were children were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world but when the fulness of the time came god sent forth his son born of a woman born under the law that he might redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons. and because ye are sons god sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father. so that thou art no longer a bondservant but a son and if a son then an heir through god. howbeit at that time not knowing god ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods but now that ye have come to know god or rather to be known by god how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again ye observe days and months and seasons and years.  i am afraid of you lest by any means i have bestowed labor upon you in vain. i beseech you brethren become as i [am] for i also [am become] as ye [are]. ye did me no wrong but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you the first time and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but ye received me as an angel of god [even] as christ jesus. where then is that gratulation of yourselves for i bear you witness that if possible ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. so then am i become your enemy by telling you the truth they zealously seek you in no good way nay they desire to shut you out that ye may seek them. but it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times and not only when i am present with you. my little children of whom i am again in travail until christ be formed in you but i could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone for i am perplexed about you. tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law for it is written that abraham had two sons one by the handmaid and one by the freewoman.  howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise. which things contain an allegory for these [women] are two covenants one from mount sinai bearing children unto bondage which is hagar. now this hagar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to the jerusalem that now is for she is in bondage with her children. but the jerusalem that is above is free which is our mother. for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband. now we brethren as isaac was are children of promise. but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the spirit so also it is now. howbeit what saith the scripture cast out the handmaid and her son for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. wherefore brethren we are not children of a handmaid but of the freewoman. for freedom did christ set us free stand fast therefore and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.  behold i paul say unto you that if ye receive circumcision christ will profit you nothing. yea i testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law. ye are severed from christ ye would be justified by the law ye are fallen away from grace. for we through the spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith working through love. ye were running well who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth this persuasion [came] not of him that calleth you. a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. i have confidence to youward in the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be. but i brethren if i still preach circumcision why am i still persecuted then hath the stumblingblock of the cross been done away. i would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision. for ye brethren were called for freedom only [use] not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh but through love be servants one to another.  for the whole law is fulfilled in one word [even] in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. but i say walk by the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh for these are contrary the one to the other that ye may not do the things that ye would. but if ye are led by the spirit ye are not under the law. now the works of the flesh are manifest which are [these] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousies wraths factions divisions parties envyings drunkenness revellings and such like of which i forewarn you even as i did forewarn you that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god. but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness meekness self control against such there is no law. and they that are of christ jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof. if we live by the spirit by the spirit let us also walk.  let us not become vainglorious provoking one another envying one another. brethren even if a man be overtaken in any trespass ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness looking to thyself lest thou also be tempted. bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ. for if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself. but let each man prove his own work and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone and not of his neighbor. for each man shall bear his own burden. but let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap. for he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth unto the spirit shall of the spirit reap eternal life. and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.  so then as we have opportunity let us work that which is good toward all men and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith. see with how large letters i write unto you with mine own hand. as many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh they compel you to be circumcised only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ. for not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. but far be it from me to glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world hath been crucified unto me and i unto the world. for neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature. and as many as shall walk by this rule peace [be] upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god. henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear branded on my body the marks of jesus. the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brethren. amen. paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god to the saints that are at ephesus and the faithful in christ jesus  grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. blessed [be] the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly [places] in christ even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through jesus christ unto himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved in whom we have our redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence making known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times to sum up all things in christ the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth in him [i say]  in whom also we were made a heritage having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory we who had before hoped in christ in whom ye also having heard the word of the truth the gospel of your salvation in whom having also believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise  which is an earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of [gods] own possession unto the praise of his glory. for this cause i also having heard of the faith in the lord jesus which is among you and the love which [ye show] toward all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention [of you] in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him having the eyes of your heart enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to that working of the strength of his might  which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly [places] far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and he put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all.  and you [did he make alive] when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the powers of the air of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest  but god being rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace have ye been saved  and raised us up with him and made us to sit with him in the heavenly [places] in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus for by grace have ye been saved through faith and that not of yourselves [it is] the gift of god not of works that no man should glory. for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works which god afore prepared that we should walk in them. wherefore remember that once ye the gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands  that ye were at that time separate from christ alienated from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without god in the world. but now in christ jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of christ. for he is our peace who made both one and brake down the middle wall of partition  having abolished in the flesh the enmity [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances that he might create in himself of the two one new man [so] making peace and might reconcile them both in one body unto god through the cross having slain the enmity thereby and he came and preached peace to you that were far off and peace to them that were nigh for through him we both have our access in one spirit unto the father. so then ye are no more strangers and sojourners but ye are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the chief corner stone in whom each several building fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god in the spirit. for this cause i paul the prisoner of christ jesus in behalf of you gentiles if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of god which was given me to youward how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in few words  whereby when ye read ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of christ which in other generation was not made known unto the sons of men as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit [to wit] that the gentiles are fellowheirs and fellowmembers of the body and fellowpartakers of the promise in christ jesus through the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of that grace of god which was given me according to the working of his power. unto me who am less than the least of all saints was this grace given to preach unto the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in god who created all things to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly [places] might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.  wherefore i ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you which are your glory. for this cause i bow my knees unto the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory that ye may be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inward man that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith to the end that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of god. now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him [be] the glory in the church and in christ jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. amen. i therefore the prisoner in the lord beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love giving diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.  [there is] one body and one spirit even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all. but unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of christ. wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. now this he ascended what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things. and he gave some [to be] apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministering unto the building up of the body of christ till we all attain unto the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a fullgrown man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  that we may be no longer children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men in craftiness after the wiles of error but speaking truth in love we may grow up in all things into him who is the head [even] christ from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth according to the working in [due] measure of each several part maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love. this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye no longer walk as the gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind being darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardening of their heart who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness. but ye did not so learn christ if so be that ye heard him and were taught in him even as truth is in jesus that ye put away as concerning your former manner of life the old man that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind  and put on the new man that after god hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth. wherefore putting away falsehood speak ye truth each one with his neighbor for we are members one of another. be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil. let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing that is good that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need. let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth but such as is good for edifying as the need may be that it may give grace to them that hear. and grieve not the holy spirit of god in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and railing be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving each other even as god also in christ forgave you. be ye therefore imitators of god as beloved children and walk in love even as christ also loved you and gave himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for an odor of a sweet smell.  but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not even be named among you as becometh saints nor filthiness nor foolish talking or jesting which are not befitting but rather giving of thanks. for this ye know of a surety that no fornicator nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and god. let no man deceive you with empty words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience. be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were once darkness but are now light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is wellpleasing unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather even reprove them for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. but all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light for everything that is made manifest is light. wherefore [he] saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall shine upon thee.  look therefore carefully how ye walk not as unwise but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil. wherefore be ye not foolish but understand what the will of the lord is. and be not drunken with wine wherein is riot but be filled with the spirit speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody with your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god even the father subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of christ. wives [be in subjection] unto your own husbands as unto the lord. for the husband is the head of the wife and christ also is the head of the church [being] himself the saviour of the body. but as the church is subject to christ so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything. husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself up for it that he might sanctify it having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word  that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church] not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish. even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. he that loveth his own wife loveth himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as christ also the church because we are members of his body. for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh. this mystery is great but i speak in regard of christ and of the church. nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself and [let] the wife [see] that she fear her husband. children obey your parents in the lord for this is right. honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth. and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the lord.  servants be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not in the way of eyeservice as menpleasers but as servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as unto the lord and not unto men knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth the same shall he receive again from the lord whether [he be] bond or free. and ye masters do the same things unto them and forbear threatening knowing that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no respect of persons with him. finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his might. put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against the powers against the worldrulers of this darkness against the spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places]. wherefore take up the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand.  stand therefore having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace withal taking up the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil [one]. and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the spirit and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints and on my behalf that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains that in it i may speak boldly as i ought to speak. but that ye also may know my affairs how i do tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things whom i have sent unto you for this very purpose that ye may know our state and that he may comfort your hearts. peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ.  grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ with [a love] incorruptible. paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all the saints in christ jesus that are at philippi with the bishops and deacons grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. i thank my god upon all my remembrance of you always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of jesus christ even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers with me of grace. for god is my witness how i long after you all in the tender mercies of christ jesus. and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment so that ye may approve the things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of christ  being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are through jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god. now i would have you know brethren that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel so that my bonds became manifest in christ throughout the whole praetorian guard and to all the rest and that most of the brethren in the lord being confident through my bonds are more abundantly bold to speak the word of god without fear. some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one [do it] of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel but the other proclaim christ of faction not sincerely thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. what then only that in every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is proclaimed and therein i rejoice yea and will rejoice. for i know that this shall turn out to my salvation through your supplication and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ  according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing shall i be put to shame but [that] with all boldness as always [so] now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death. for to me to live is christ and to die is gain. but if to live in the flesh [if] this shall bring fruit from my work then what i shall choose i know not. but i am in a strait betwixt the two having the desire to depart and be with christ for it is very far better yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. and having this confidence i know that i shall abide yea and abide with you all for your progress and joy in the faith that your glorying may abound in christ jesus in me through my presence with you again. only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you and be absent i may hear of your state that ye stand fast in one spirit with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries which is for them an evident token of perdition but of your salvation and that from god  because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer in his behalf having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me. if there is therefore any exhortation in christ if any consolation of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any tender mercies and compassions make full my joy that ye be of the same mind having the same love being of one accord of one mind [doing] nothing through faction or through vainglory but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself not looking each of you to his own things but each of you also to the things of others. have this mind in you which was also in christ jesus who existing in the form of god counted not the being on an equality with god a thing to be grasped but emptied himself taking the form of a servant being made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself becoming obedient [even] unto death yea the death of the cross. wherefore also god highly exalted him and gave unto him the name which is above every name  that in the name of jesus every knee should bow of [things] in heaven and [things] on earth and [things] under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father. so then my beloved even as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who worketh in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. do all things without murmurings and questionings that ye may become blameless and harmless children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom ye are seen as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may have whereof to glory in the day of christ that i did not run in vain neither labor in vain. yea and if i am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all and in the same manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me. but i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state.  for i have no man likeminded who will care truly for your state. for they all seek their own not the things of jesus christ. but ye know the proof of him that as a child [serveth] a father [so] he served with me in furtherance of the gospel. him therefore i hope to send forthwith so soon as i shall see how it will go with me but i trust in the lord that i myself also shall come shortly. but i counted it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and fellowworker and fellowsoldier and your messenger and minister to my need  since he longed after you all and was sore troubled because ye had heard that he was sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also that i might not have sorrow upon sorrow. i have sent him therefore the more diligently that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful. receive him therefore in the lord with all joy and hold such in honor because for the work of christ he came nigh unto death hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.  finally my brethren rejoice in the lord. to write the same things to you to me indeed is not irksome but for you it is safe. beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of the concision for we are the circumcision who worship by the spirit of god and glory in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though i myself might have confidence even in the flesh if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh i yet more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews as touching the law a pharisee  as touching zeal persecuting the church as touching the righteousness which is in the law found blameless. howbeit what things were gain to me these have i counted loss for christ. yea verily and i count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i suffered the loss of all things and do count them but refuse that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of mine own [even] that which is of the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness which is from god by faith  that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings becoming conformed unto his death if by any means i may attain unto the resurrection from the dead. not that i have already obtained or am already made perfect but i press on if so be that i may lay hold on that for which also i was laid hold on by christ jesus. brethren i could not myself yet to have laid hold but one thing [i do] forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before i press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus.  let us therefore as many as are perfect be thus minded and if in anything ye are otherwise minded this also shall god reveal unto you only whereunto we have attained by that same [rule] let us walk. brethren be ye imitators together of me and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample. for many walk of whom i told you often and now tell you even weeping [that they are] the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is perdition whose god is the belly and [whose] glory is in their shame who mind earthly things.  for our citizenship is in heaven whence also we wait for a saviour the lord jesus christ who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation [that it may be] conformed to the body of his glory according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself. wherefore my brethren beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my beloved. i exhort euodia and i exhort syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord. yea i beseech thee also true yokefellow help these women for they labored with me in the gospel with clement also and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life. rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice. let your forbearance be known unto all men. the lord is at hand. in nothing be anxious but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god. and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in christ jesus.  finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honorable whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things. the things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me these things do and the god of peace shall be with you. but i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at length ye have revived your thought for me wherein ye did indeed take thought but ye lacked opportunity. not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therein to be content. i know how to be abased and i know also how to abound in everything and in all things have i learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry both to abound and to be in want. i can do all things in him that strengtheneth me. howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.  and ye yourselves also know ye philippians that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need. not that i seek for the gift but i seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. but i have all things and abound i am filled having received from epaphroditus the things [that came] from you and odor of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to god. and my god shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in christ jesus. now unto our god and father [be] the glory for ever and ever. amen. salute every saint in christ jesus. the brethren that are with me salute you. all the saints salute you especially they that are of caesars household. the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit. paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god and timothy our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ [that are] at colossae grace to you and peace from god our father.  we give thanks to god the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you having heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have toward all the saints because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing as [it doth] in you also since the day ye heard and knew the grace of god in truth even as ye learned of epaphras our beloved fellow servant who is a faithful minister of christ on our behalf who also declared unto us your love in the spirit. for this cause we also since the day we heard [it] do not cease to pray and make request for you that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding to walk worthily of the lord unto all pleasing bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all patience and longsuffering with joy giving thanks unto the father who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light  who delivered us out of the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love in whom we have our redemption the forgiveness of our sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for in him were all things created in the heavens and upon the earth things visible and things invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things have been created through him and unto him and he is before all things and in him all things consist. and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence. for it was the good pleasure [of the father] that in him should all the fulness dwell and through him to reconcile all things unto himself having made peace through the blood of his cross through him [i say] whether things upon the earth or things in the heavens. and you being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him  if so be that ye continue in the faith grounded and stedfast and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard which was preached in all creation under heaven whereof i paul was made a minister. now i rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is the church whereof i was made a minister according to the dispensation of god which was given me to you ward to fulfil the word of god [even] the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations but now hath it been manifested to his saints to whom god was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we proclaim admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ whereunto i labor also striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily. for i would have you know how greatly i strive for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh  that their hearts may be comforted they being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding that they may know the mystery of god [even] christ in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden. this i say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech. for though i am absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ. as therefore ye received christ jesus the lord [so] walk in him rooted and builded up in him and established in your faith even as ye were taught abounding in thanksgiving. take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily and in him ye are made full who is the head of all principality and power in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ  having been buried with him in baptism wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of god who raised him from the dead. and you being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh you [i say] did he make alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and he hath taken it out that way nailing it to the cross having despoiled the principalities and the powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it. let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day which are a shadow of the things to come but the body is christs. let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels dwelling in the things which he hath seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding fast the head from whom all the body being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands increasing with the increase of god.  if ye died with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances handle not nor taste nor touch all which things are to perish with the using after the precepts and doctrines of men which things have indeed a show of wisdom in willworship and humility and severity to the body [but are] not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh. if then ye were raised together with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated on the right hand of god. set your mind on the things that are above not on the things that are upon the earth. for ye died and your life is hid with christ in god. when christ [who is] our life shall be manifested then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory. put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness passion evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience wherein ye also once walked when ye lived in these things  but now do ye also put them all away anger wrath malice railing shameful speaking out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him where there cannot be greek and jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian scythian bondman freeman but christ is all and in all. put on therefore as gods elect holy and beloved a heart of compassion kindness lowliness meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving each other if any man have a complaint against any even as the lord forgave you so also do ye and above all these things [put on] love which is the bond of perfectness. and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts to the which also ye were called in one body and be ye thankful. let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms [and] hymns [and] spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts unto god.  and whatsoever ye do in word or in deed [do] all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him. wives be in subjection to your husbands as is fitting in the lord. husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them. children obey your parents in all things for this is wellpleasing in the lord. fathers provoke not your children that they be not discouraged. servants obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing the lord whatsoever ye do work heartily as unto the lord and not unto men knowing that from the lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance ye serve the lord christ. for he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done and there is no respect of persons. masters render unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven. continue stedfastly in prayer watching therein with thanksgiving withal praying for us also that god may open unto us a door for the word to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds  that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak. walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time. let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one. all my affairs shall tychicus make known unto you the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord whom i have sent you for this very purpose that ye may know our state and that he may comfort your hearts together with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you. they shall make known unto you all things that [are done] here. aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and mark the cousin of barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive him and jesus that is called justus who are of the circumcision these only [are my] fellow workers unto the kingdom of god men that have been a comfort unto me. epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus saluteth you always striving for you in his prayers that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of god.  for i bear him witness that he hath much labor for you and for them in laodicea and for them in hierapolis. luke the beloved physician and demas salute you. salute the brethren that are in laodicea and nymphas and the church that is in their house. and when this epistle hath been read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye also read the epistle from laodicea. and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord that thou fulfil it. the salutation of me paul with mine own hand. remember my bonds. grace be with you. paul and silvanus and timothy unto the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace. we give thanks to god always for you all making mention [of you] in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ before our god and father knowing brethren beloved of god your election  how that our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and [in] much assurance even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake. and ye became imitators of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy spirit so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in macedonia and in achaia. for from you hath sounded forth the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith to godward is gone forth so that we need not to speak anything. for they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned unto god from idols to serve a living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead [even] jesus who delivereth us from the wrath to come. for yourselves brethren know our entering in unto you that it hath not been found vain but having suffered before and been shamefully treated as ye know at philippi we waxed bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god in much conflict.  for our exhortation [is] not of error nor of uncleanness nor in guile but even as we have been approved of god to be intrusted with the gospel so we speak not as pleasing men but god who proveth our hearts. for neither at any time were we found using words of flattery as ye know nor a cloak of covetousness god is witness nor seeking glory of men neither from you nor from others when we might have claimed authority as apostles of christ. but we were gentle in the midst of you as when a nurse cherisheth her own children even so being affectionately desirous of you we were well pleased to impart unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because ye were become very dear to us. for ye remember brethren our labor and travail working night and day that we might not burden any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god. ye are witnesses and god [also] how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe as ye know how we [dealt with] each one of you as a father with his own children exhorting you and encouraging [you] and testifying  to the end that ye should walk worthily of god who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory. and for this cause we also thank god without ceasing that when ye received from us the word of the message [even the word] of god ye accepted [it] not [as] the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which also worketh in you that believe. for ye brethren became imitators of the churches of god which are in judaea in christ jesus for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen even as they did of the jews who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets and drove out us and pleased not god and are contrary to all men forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they may be saved to fill up their sins always but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. but we brethren being bereaved of you for a short season in presence not in heart endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire because we would fain have come unto you i paul once and again and satan hindered us. for what is our hope or joy or crown of glorying are not even ye before our lord jesus at his coming  for ye are our glory and our joy. wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left behind at athens alone and sent timothy our brother and gods minister in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort [you] concerning your faith that no man be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed. for verily when we were with you we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction even as it came to pass and ye know. for this cause i also when i could no longer forbear sent that i might know your faith lest by any means the tempter had tempted you and our labor should be in vain.  but when timothy came even now unto us from you and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love and that ye have good remembrance of us always longing to see us even as we also [to see] you for this cause brethren we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord. for what thanksgiving can we render again unto god for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god  night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus direct our way unto you and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we also [do] toward you to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints. finally then brethren we beseech and exhort you in the lord jesus that as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god even as ye do walk  that ye abound more and more.  for ye know what charge we gave you through the lord jesus. for this is the will of god [even] your sanctification that ye abstain from fornication that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor not in the passion of lust even as the gentiles who know not god that no man transgress and wrong his brother in the matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things as also we forewarned you and testified.  for god called us not for uncleanness but in sanctification. therefore he that rejecteth rejecteth not man but god who giveth his holy spirit unto you. but concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all macedonia. but we exhort you brethren that ye abound more and more and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your hands even as we charged you that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without and may have need of nothing. but we would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them that fall asleep that ye sorrow not even as the rest who have no hope.  for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also that are fallen asleep in jesus will god bring with him. for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we that are alive that are left unto the coming of the lord shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.  for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we that are alive that are left shall together with them be caught up in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord. wherefore comfort one another with these words. but concerning the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that aught be written unto you. for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night. when they are saying peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall in no wise escape. but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief for ye are all sons of light and sons of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness so then let us not sleep as do the rest but let us watch and be sober. for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.  but let us since we are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation. for god appointed us not into wrath but unto the obtaining of salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him. wherefore exhort one another and build each other up even as also ye do. but we beseech you brethren to know them that labor among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their works sake. be at peace among yourselves. and we exhort you brethren admonish the disorderly encourage the fainthearted support the weak be longsuffering toward all. see that none render unto any one evil for evil but always follow after that which is good one toward another and toward all. rejoice always pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus to youward. quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from every form of evil.  and the god of peace himself sanctify you wholly and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our lord jesus christ. faithful is he that calleth you who will also do it. brethren pray for us. salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. i adjure you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren. the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you. paul and silvanus and timothy unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ. we are bound to give thanks to god always to you brethren even as it is meet for that your faith growth exceedingly and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure [which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer  if so be that it is righteous thing with god to recompense affliction to them that afflict you and to you that are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the lord jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire rendering vengeance to them that know not god and to them that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus who shall suffer punishment [even] eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his might when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be marvelled at in all them that believed because our testimony unto you was believed in that day. to which end we also pray always for you that our god may count you worthy of your calling and fulfil every desire of goodness and [every] work of faith with power that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ. now we beseech you brethren touching the coming of our lord jesus christ and our gathering together unto him  to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind nor yet be troubled either by spirit or by word or by epistle as from us as that the day of the lord is just at hand let no man beguile you in any wise for [it will not be] except the falling away come first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he sitteth in the temple of god setting himself forth as god. remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know that which restraineth to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. for the mystery of lawlessness doth already work only [there is] one that restraineth now until he be taken out of the way. and then shall be revealed the lawless one whom the lord jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming [even he] whose coming is according to the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders  and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved. and for this cause god sendeth them a working of error that they should believe a lie that they all might be judged who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. but we are bound to give thanks to god always for you brethren beloved of the lord for that god chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he called you through our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ. so then brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye were taught whether by word or by epistle of ours. now our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word. finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may run and be glorified even as also [it is] with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men for all have not faith.  but the lord is faithful who shall establish you and guard you from the evil [one]. and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command. and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patience of christ. now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which they received of us. for yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you neither did we eat bread for nought at any mans hand but in labor and travail working night and day that we might not burden any of you not because we have not the right but to make ourselves and ensample unto you that ye should imitate us. for even when we were with you this we commanded you if any will not work neither let him eat. for we hear of some that walk among you disorderly that work not at all but are busybodies.  now them that are such we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread. but ye brethren be not weary in welldoing. and if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle note that man that ye have no company with him to the end that he may be ashamed. and [yet] count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother. now the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. the lord be with you all. the salutation of me paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write. the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all. paul an apostle of christ jesus according to the commandment of god our saviour and christ jesus our hope unto timothy my true child in faith grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord. as i exhorted thee to tarry at ephesus when i was going into macedonia that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questionings rather than a dispensation of god which is in faith [so do i now].  but the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking desiring to be teachers of the law though they understand neither what they say nor whereof they confidently affirm. but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully as knowing this that law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and unruly for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers for fornicators for abusers of themselves with men for menstealers for liars for false swearers and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god which was committed to my trust. i thank him that enabled me [even] christ jesus our lord for that he counted me faithful appointing me to [his] service though i was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious howbeit i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief  and the grace of our lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in christ jesus. faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me as chief might jesus christ show forth all his longsuffering for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life. now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only god [be] honor and glory forever and ever. amen. this charge i commit unto thee my child timothy according to the prophecies which led the way to thee that by them thou mayest war the good warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith of whom is hymenaeus and alexander whom i delivered unto satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme. i exhort therefore first of all that supplications prayers intercessions thanksgivings be made for all men for kings and all that are in high place that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.  this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour who would have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. for there is one god one mediator also between god and men [himself] man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all the testimony [to be borne] in its own times whereunto i was appointed a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth i lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth. i desire therefore that the men pray in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing. in like manner that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly raiment but which becometh women professing godliness through good works. let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. but i permit not a woman to teach nor to have dominion over a man but to be in quietness. for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not beguiled but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression  but she shall be saved through her childbearing if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety. faithful is the saying if a man seeketh the office of a bishop he desireth a good work. the bishop therefore must be without reproach the husband of one wife temperate soberminded orderly given to hospitality apt to teach no brawler no striker but gentle not contentious no lover of money one that ruleth well his own house having [his] children in subjection with all gravity but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god not a novice lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil. moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. deacons in like manner [must be] grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. and let these also first be proved then let them serve as deacons if they be blameless.  women in like manner [must be] grave not slanderers temperate faithful in all things. let deacons be husbands of one wife ruling [their] children and their own houses well. for they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus. these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth. and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness he who was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached among the nations believed on in the world received up in glory. but the spirit saith expressly that in later times some shall fall away from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron forbidding to marry [and commanding] to abstain from meats which god created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.  for every creature of god is good and nothing is to be rejected if it be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified through the word of god and prayer. if thou put the brethren in mind of these things thou shalt be a good minister of christ jesus nourished in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed [until now] but refuse profane and old wives fables. and exercise thyself unto godliness for bodily exercise is profitable for a little but godliness is profitable for all things having promise of the life which now is and of that which is to come. faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptation. for to this end we labor and strive because we have our hope set on the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of them that believe. these things command and teach. let no man despise thy youth but be thou an ensample to them that believe in word in manner of life in love in faith in purity. till i come give heed to reading to exhortation to teaching.  neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. be diligent in these things give thyself wholly to them that thy progress may be manifest unto all. take heed to thyself and to thy teaching. continue in these things for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee. rebuke not an elder but exhort him as a father the younger men as brethren the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters in all purity. honor widows that are widows indeed. but if any widow hath children or grandchildren let them learn first to show piety towards their own family and to requite their parents for this is acceptable in the sight of god.  now she that is a widow indeed and desolate hath her hope set on god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. but she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth. these things also command that they may be without reproach. but if any provideth not for his own and specially his own household he hath denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.  let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old [having been] the wife of one man well reported of for good works if she hath brought up children if she hath used hospitality to strangers if she hath washed the saints feet if she hath relieved the afflicted if she hath diligently followed every good work. but younger widows refuse for when they have waxed wanton against christ they desire to marry having condemnation because they have rejected their first pledge. and withal they learn also [to be] idle going about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not. i desire therefore that the younger [widows] marry bear children rule the household give no occasion to the adversary for reviling  for already some are turned aside after satan. if any woman that believeth hath widows let her relieve them and let not the church be burdened that it mat relieve them that are widows indeed. let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.  for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. and the laborer is worthy of his hire. against an elder receive not an accusation except at [the mouth of] two or three witnesses. them that sin reprove in the sight of all that the rest also may be in fear. i charge [thee] in the sight of god and christ jesus and the elect angels that thou observe these things without prejudice doing nothing by partiality. lay hands hastily on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pure. be no longer a drinker of water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities. some mens sins are evident going before unto judgment and some men also they follow after. in like manner also there are good works that are evident and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.  let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor that the name of god and the doctrine be not blasphemed.  and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but let them serve them the rather because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. these things teach and exhort. if any man teacheth a different doctrine and consenteth not to sound words [even] the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is puffed up knowing nothing but doting about questionings and disputes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth supposing that godliness is a way of gain. but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into the world for neither can we carry anything out but having food and covering we shall be therewith content. but they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts such as drown men in destruction and perdition. for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.  but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness. fight the good fight of the faith lay hold on the life eternal whereunto thou wast called and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. i charge thee in the sight of god who giveth life to all things and of christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed the good confession that thou keep the commandment without spot without reproach until the appearing of our lord jesus christ which in its own times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in light unapproachable whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom [be] honor and power eternal. amen. charge them that are rich in this present world that they be not highminded nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches but on god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good works that they be ready to distribute willing to communicate  laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on the life which is [life] indeed. o timothy guard that which is committed unto [thee] turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith. grace be with you. paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god according to the promise of the life which is in christ jesus to timothy my beloved child grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord. i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day longing to see thee remembering thy tears that i may be filled with joy having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded in thee also. for which cause i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.  for god gave us not a spirit of fearfulness but of power and love and discipline. be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of god who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before times eternal but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our saviour christ jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto i was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher. for which cause i suffer also these things yet i am not ashamed for i know him whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he is able to guard that which i have committed unto him against that day. hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me in faith and love which is in christ jesus. that good thing which was committed unto [thee] guard through the holy spirit which dwelleth in us. this thou knowest that all that are in asia turned away from me of whom are phygelus and hermogenes.  the lord grant mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me diligently and found me the lord grant unto him to find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered at ephesus thou knowest very well. thou therefore my child be strengthened in the grace that is in christ jesus. and the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. suffer hardship with [me] as a good soldier of christ jesus. no soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of [this] life that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. and if also a man contend in the games he is not crowded except he have contended lawfully. the husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits. consider what i say for the lord shall give thee understanding in all things. remember jesus christ risen from the dead of the seed of david according to my gospel  wherein i suffer hardship unto bonds as a malefactor but the word of god is not bound. therefore i endure all things for the elects sake that they also may obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory. faithful is the saying for if we died with him we shall also live with him if we endure we shall also reign with him if we shall deny him he also will deny us if we are faithless he abideth faithful for he cannot deny himself. of these things put them in remembrance charging [them] in the sight of the lord that they strive not about words to no profit to the subverting of them that hear. give diligence to present thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed handling aright the word of truth. but shun profane babblings for they will proceed further in ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a gangrene or whom is hymenaeus an philetus men who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some.  howbeit the firm foundation of god standeth having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of the lord depart from unrighteousness. now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some unto honor and some unto dishonor. if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified meet for the masters use prepared unto every good work. after righteousness faith love pace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart. but foolish and ignorant questionings refuse knowing that they gender strifes. and the lords servant must not strive but be gentle towards all apt to teach forbearing in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves if peradventure god may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him unto his will. but know this that in the last days grievous times shall come.  for men shall be lovers of self lovers of money boastful haughty railers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection implacable slanderers without self control fierce no lovers of good traitors headstrong puffed up lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god holding a form of godliness but having denied the power therefore. from these also turn away. for of these are they that creep into houses and take captive silly women laden with sins led away by divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. and even as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also withstand the truth. men corrupted in mind reprobate concerning the faith. but they shall proceed no further. for their folly shall be evident unto all men as theirs also came to be. but thou didst follow my teaching conduct purpose faith longsuffering love patience persecutions sufferings. what things befell me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured. and out of them all the lord delivered me.  yea and all that would live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution. but evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived. but abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them. and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus. every scripture inspired of god [is] also profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for instruction which is in righteousness. that the man of god may be complete furnished completely unto every good work. i charge [thee] in the sight of god and of christ jesus who shall judge the living and the dead and by his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be urgent in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching. for the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine but having itching ears will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts and will turn away their ears from the truth and turn aside unto fables.  but be thou sober in all things suffer hardship do the work of an evangelist fulfil thy ministry. for i am already being offered and the time of my departure is come. i have fought the good fight i have finished the course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give to me at that day and not to me only but also to all them that have loved his appearing. give diligence to come shortly unto me for demas forsook me having loved this present world and went to thessalonica crescens to galatia titus to dalmatia. only luke is with me. take mark and bring him with thee for he is useful to me for ministering. but tychicus i sent to ephesus. the cloak that i left at troas with carpus bring when thou comest and the books especially the parchments. alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord will render to him according to his works of whom do thou also beware for he greatly withstood our words. at my first defence no one took my part but all forsook me may it not be laid to their account.  but the lord stood by me and strengthened me that through me the message might me fully proclaimed and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. the lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. amen. salute prisca and aquila and the house of onesiphorus. erastus remained at corinth but trophimus i left at miletus sick. give diligence to come before winter. eubulus saluteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren. the lord be with thy spirit. grace be with you. paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness in hope of eternal life which god who cannot lie promised before times eternal but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message wherewith i was intrusted according to the commandment of god our saviour to titus my true child after a common faith grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our saviour.  for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting and appoint elders in every city as i gave thee charge if any man is blameless the husband of one wife having children that believe who are not accused of riot or unruly. for the bishop must be blameless as gods steward not selfwilled not soon angry no brawler no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but given to hospitality as lover of good soberminded just holy self controlled holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine and to convict the gainsayers. for there are many unruly men vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision whose mouths must be stopped men who overthrow whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres sake. one of themselves a prophet of their own said cretans are always liars evil beasts idle gluttons. this testimony is true. for which cause reprove them sharply that they may be sound in the faith  not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. to the pure all things are pure but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. they profess that they know god but by their works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate. but speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine that aged men be temperate grave soberminded sound in faith in love in patience that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine teachers of that which is good that they may train the young women to love their husbands to love their children [to be] sober minded chaste workers at home kind being in subjection to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed the younger men likewise exhort to be soberminded in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works in thy doctrine [showing] uncorruptness gravity  sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of us. [exhort] servants to be in subjection to their own masters [and] to be well pleasing [to them] in all things not gainsaying not purloining but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things. for the grace of god hath appeared bringing salvation to all men instructing us to the intent that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great god and our saviour jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people for his own possession zealous of good works. these things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. let no man despise thee. put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers to authorities to be obedient to be ready unto every good work to speak evil of no man not to be contentious to be gentle showing all meekness toward all men.  for we also once were foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful hating one another. but when the kindness of god our saviour and his love toward man appeared not by works [done] in righteousness which we did ourselves but according to his mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit which he poured out upon us richly through jesus christ our saviour that being justified by his grace we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. faithful is the saying and concerning these things i desire that thou affirm confidently to the end that they who have believed god may be careful to maintain good works. these things are good and profitable unto men but shun foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and fightings about law for they are unprofitable and vain. a factious man after a first and second admonition refuse knowing that such a one is perverted and sinneth being selfcondemned.  when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus give diligence to come unto me to nicopolis for there i have determined to winter. set forward zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them. and let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful. all that are with me salute thee. salute them that love us in faith. grace be with you all. paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy our brother to philemon our beloved and fellowworker and to apphia our sister and to archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. i thank my god always making mention of thee in my prayers hearing of thy love and of the faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all the saints that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you unto christ. for i had much joy and comfort in thy love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee brother.  wherefore though i have all boldness in christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting yet for loves sake i rather beseech being such a one as paul the aged and now a prisoner also of christ jesus i beseech thee for my child whom i have begotten in my bonds onesimus who once was unprofitable to thee but now is profitable to thee and to me whom i have sent back to thee in his own person that is my very heart whom i would fain have kept with me that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel but without thy mind i would do nothing that thy goodness should not be as of necessity but of free will. for perhaps he was therefore parted [from thee] for a season that thou shouldest have him for ever no longer as a servant but more than a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much rather to thee both in the flesh and in the lord.  if then thou countest me a partner receive him as myself. but if he hath wronged the at all or oweth [thee] aught put that to mine account  i paul write it with mine own hand i will repay it that i say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides. yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my heart in christ. having confidence in thine obedience i write unto thee knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what i say. but withal prepare me also a lodging for i hope that through your prayers i shall be granted unto you. epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus saluteth thee [and so do] mark aristarchus demas luke my fellowworkers. the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit. amen. god having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in [his] son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the worlds who being the effulgence of his glory and the very image of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had made purification of sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high  having become by so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.  for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him. and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels winds and his ministers a flame a fire but of the son [he saith] thy throne o god is for ever and ever and the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. and thou lord in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thy hands they shall perish but thou continuest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a mantle shalt thou roll them up as a garment and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail.  but of which of the angels hath he said at any time sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet  are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard lest haply we drift away [from them]. for if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which having at the first been spoken through the lord was confirmed unto us by them that heard god also bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by manifold powers and by gifts of the holy spirit according to his own will. for not unto angels did he subject the world to come whereof we speak. but one hath somewhere testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honor and didst set him over the works of thy hands  thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet. for in that he subjected all things unto him he left nothing that is not subject to him. but now we see not yet all things subjected to him. but we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels [even] jesus because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that by the grace of god he should taste of death for every [man]. for it became him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. for both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i sing thy praise. and again i will put my trust in him. and again behold i and the children whom god hath given me. since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood he also himself in like manner partook of the same that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death that is the devil  and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. for verily not to angels doth he give help but he giveth help to the seed of abraham. wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make propitiation for the sins of the people. for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succor them that are tempted. wherefore holy brethren partakers of a heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our confession [even] jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also was moses in all his house. for he hath been counted worthy of more glory than moses by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house. for every house is builded by some one but he that built all things is god. and moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken  but christ as a son over his house whose house are we if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. wherefore even as the holy spirit saith today if ye shall hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness where your fathers tried [me] by proving [me] and saw my works forty years. wherefore i was displeased with this generation and said they do always err in their heart but they did not know my ways as i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. take heed brethren lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living god but exhort one another day by day so long as it is called today lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin for we are become partakers of christ if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end while it is said today if ye shall hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation. for who when they heard did provoke nay did not all they that came out of egypt by moses  and with whom was he displeased forty years was it not with them that sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that were disobedient and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. let us fear therefore lest haply a promise being left of entering into his rest any one of you should seem to have come short of it. for indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us even as also they but the word of hearing did not profit them because it was not united by faith with them that heard. for we who have believed do enter into that rest even as he hath said as i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. for he hath said somewhere of the seventh [day] on this wise and god rested on the seventh day from all his works and in this [place] again they shall not enter into my rest. seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience  he again defineth a certain day to day saying in david so long a time afterward even as hath been said before today if ye shall hear his voice harden not your hearts. for if joshua had given them rest he would not have spoken afterward of another day. there remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of god. for he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works as god did from his. let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest that no man fall after the same example of disobedience. for the word of god is living and active and sharper than any twoedged sword and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. and there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. having then a great high priest who hath passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our confession.  for we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but one that hath been in all points tempted like as [we are yet] without sin. let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help [us] in time of need. for every high priest being taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason thereof is bound as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins. and no man taketh the honor unto himself but when he is called of god even as was aaron. so christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that spake unto him thou art my son this day have i begotten thee as he saith also in another [place] thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek.  who in the days of his flesh having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and having been heard for his godly fear though he was a son yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered and having been made perfect he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation named of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek. of whom we have many things to say and hard of interpretation seeing ye are become dull of hearing. for when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of solid food. for every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness for he is a babe. but solid food is for fullgrown men [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.  wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of christ let us press on unto perfection not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the teaching of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. and this will we do if god permit. for as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy spirit and tasted the good word of god and the powers of the age to come and [then] fell away it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame. for the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled receiveth blessing from god but if it beareth thorns and thistles it is rejected and nigh unto a curse whose end is to be burned. but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak  for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name in that ye ministered unto the saints and still do minister. and we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end that ye be not sluggish but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. for when god made promise to abraham since he could swear by none greater he sware by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee. and thus having patiently endured he obtained the promise. for men swear by the greater and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation. wherein god being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel interposed with an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for god to lie we may have a strong encouragement who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us which we have as an anchor of the soul [a hope] both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil  whither as a forerunner jesus entered for us having become a high priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. for this melchizedek king of salem priest of god most high who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham divided a tenth part of all being first by interpretation king of righteousness and then also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually. now consider how great this man was unto whom abraham the patriarch gave a tenth out of the chief spoils. and they indeed of the sons of levi that receive the priests office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though these have come out of the loins of abraham but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of abraham and hath blessed him that hath the promises. but without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.  and here men that die receive tithes but there one of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. and so to say through abraham even levi who receiveth tithes hath paid tithes for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him. now if there was perfection through the levitical priesthood for under it hath the people received the law what further need [was there] that another priest should arise after the order of melchizedek and not be reckoned after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law. for he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe from which no man hath given attendance at the altar. for it is evident that our lord hath sprung out of judah as to which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priests. and [what we say] is yet more abundantly evident if after the likeness of melchizedek there ariseth another priest who hath been made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life  for it is witnessed [of him] thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. for there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness for the law made nothing perfect and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope through which we draw nigh unto god. and inasmuch as [it is] not without the taking of an oath for they indeed have been made priests without an oath but he with an oath by him that saith of him the lord sware and will not repent himself thou art a priest for ever by so much also hath jesus become the surety of a better covenant. and they indeed have been made priests many in number because that by death they are hindered from continuing but he because he abideth for ever hath his priesthood unchangeable. wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto god through him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. for such a high priest became us holy guileless undefiled separated from sinners and made higher than the heavens  who needeth not daily like those high priests to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for the [sins] of the people for this he did once for all when he offered up himself. for the law appointeth men high priests having infirmity but the word of the oath which was after the law [appointeth] a son perfected for evermore. now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this] we have such a high priest who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched not man. for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer. now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things even as moses is warned [of god] when he is about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.  but now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant which hath been enacted upon better promises. for if that first [covenant] had been faultless then would no place have been sought for a second. for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of egypt for they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord. for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and on their heart also will i write them and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them. for i will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins will i remember no more.  in that he saith a new [covenant] he hath made the first old. but that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away. now even a first [covenant] had ordinances of divine service and its sanctuary [a sanctuary] of this world. for there was a tabernacle prepared the first wherein [were] the candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the holy place. and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein [was] a golden pot holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercyseat of which things we cannot now speak severally. now these things having been thus prepared the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle accomplishing the services but into the second the high priest alone once in the year not without blood which he offereth for himself and for the errors of the people  the holy spirit this signifying that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest while the first tabernacle is yet standing which [is] a figure for the time present according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot as touching the conscience make the worshipper perfect [being] only with meats and drinks and divers washings carnal ordinances imposed until a time of reformation. but christ having come a high priest of the good things to come through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this creation nor yet through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood entered in once for all into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption. for if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish unto god cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living god  and for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. for where a testament is there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.  for a testament is of force where there hath been death for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth. wherefore even the first [covenant] hath not been dedicated without blood. for when every commandment had been spoken by moses unto all the people according to the law he took the blood of the calves and the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people saying this is the blood of the covenant which god commanded to youward. moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. and according to the law i may almost say all things are cleansed with blood and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.  it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. for christ entered not into a holy place made with hands like in pattern to the true but into heaven itself now to appear before the face of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own  else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. and inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die and after this [cometh] judgment so christ also having been once offered to bear the sins of many shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for him unto salvation. for the law having a shadow of the good [things] to come not the very image of the things can never with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make perfect them that draw nigh.  else would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshippers having been once cleansed would have had no more consciousness of sins. but in those [sacrifices] there is a remembrance made of sins year by year. for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body didst thou prepare for me in whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hadst no pleasure  then said i lo i am come in the roll of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god. saying above sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein the which are offered according to the law then hath he said lo i am come to do thy will. he taketh away the first that he may establish the second. by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all.  and every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices the which can never take away sins but he when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet. for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. and the holy spirit also beareth witness to us for after he hath said this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws on their heart and upon their mind also will i write them [then saith he] and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more. now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin. having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of jesus by the way which he dedicated for us a new and living way through the veil that is to say his flesh and [having] a great priest over the house of god  let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaking our own assembling together as the custom of some is but exhorting [one another] and so much the more as ye see the day drawing nigh. for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries. a man that hath set at nought moses law dieth without compassion on [the word of] two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment think ye shall he be judged worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace  for we know him that said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense. and again the lord shall judge his people. it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god. but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were enlightened ye endured a great conflict of sufferings partly being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly becoming partakers with them that were so used. for ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one. cast not away therefore your boldness which hath great recompense of reward. for ye have need of patience that having done the will of god ye may receive the promise. for yet a very little while he that cometh shall come and shall not tarry. but my righteous one shall live by faith and if he shrink back my soul hath no pleasure in him. but we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.  now faith is assurance of [things] hoped for a conviction of things not seen. for therein the elders had witness borne to them. by faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of god so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear. by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous god bearing witness in respect of his gifts and through it he being dead yet speaketh. by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because god translated him for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing unto god and without faith it is impossible to be wellpleasing [unto him] for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and [that] he is a rewarder of them that seek after him. by faith noah being warned [of god] concerning things not seen as yet moved with godly fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.  by faith abraham when he was called obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance and he went out not knowing whither he went. by faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise as in a [land] not his own dwelling in tents with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for the city which hath the foundations whose builder and maker is god. by faith even sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age since she counted him faithful who had promised wherefore also there sprang of one and him as good as dead [so many] as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them and greeted them from afar and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. for they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own. and if indeed they had been mindful of that [country] from which they went out they would have had opportunity to return.  but now they desire a better [country] that is a heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed of them to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city. by faith abraham being tried offered up isaac yea he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten [son] even he to whom it was said in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god [is] able to raise up even from the dead from whence he did also in a figure receive him back. by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau even concerning things to come. by faith jacob when he was dying blessed each of the sons of joseph and worshipped [leaning] upon the top of his staff. by faith joseph when his end was nigh made mention of the departure of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones. by faith moses when he was born was hid three months by his parents because they saw he was a goodly child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment. by faith moses when he was grown up refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter  choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season accounting the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt for he looked unto the recompense of reward. by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. by faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up. by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they had been compassed about for seven days. by faith rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient having received the spies with peace. and what shall i more say for the time will fail me if i tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions  quenched the power of fire escaped the edge of the sword from weakness were made strong waxed mighty in war turned to flight armies of aliens. women received their dead by a resurrection and others were tortured not accepting their deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they went about in sheepskins in goatskins being destitute afflicted ill treated of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and the holes of the earth. and these all having had witness borne to them through their faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing concerning us that apart from us they should not be made perfect. therefore let us also seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us  looking unto jesus the author and perfecter of [our] faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising shame and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of god. for consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself that ye wax not weary fainting in your souls. ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons my son regard not lightly the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art reproved of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. it is for chastening that ye endure god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is there whom [his] father chasteneth not but if ye are without chastening whereof all have been made partakers then are ye bastards and not sons. furthermore we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they indeed for a few days chastened [us] as seemed good to them but he for [our] profit that [we] may be partakers of his holiness.  all chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby [even the fruit] of righteousness. wherefore lift up the hands that hang down and the palsied knees and make straight paths for your feet that that which is lame be not turned out of the way but rather be healed. follow after peace with all men and the sanctification without which no man shall see the lord looking carefully lest [there be] any man that falleth short of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you] and thereby the many be defiled lest [there be] any fornication or profane person as esau who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright. for ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no place for a change of mind [in his father] though he sought is diligently with tears. for ye are not come unto [a mount] that might be touched and that burned with fire and unto blackness and darkness and tempest  and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which [voice] they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them for they could not endure that which was enjoined if even a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned and so fearful was the appearance [that] moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable hosts of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than [that of] abel. see that ye refuse not him that speaketh. for if they escaped not when they refused him that warned [them] on earth much more [shall not] we [escape] who turn away from him that [warneth] from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more will i make to tremble not the earth only but also the heaven.  and this [word] yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that have been made that those things which are not shaken may remain. wherefore receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us have grace whereby we may offer service well pleasing to god with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire. let love of the brethren continue. forget not to show love unto strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. remember them that are in bonds as bound with them them that are illtreated as being yourselves also in the body. [let] marriage [be] had in honor among all and [let] the bed [be] undefiled for fornicators and adulterers god will judge. be ye free from the love of money content with such things as ye have for himself hath said i will in no wise fail thee neither will i in any wise forsake thee. so that with good courage we say the lord is my helper i will not fear what shall man do unto me remember them that had the rule over you men that spake unto you the word of god and considering the issue of their life imitate their faith.  jesus christ [is] the same yesterday and to day [yea] and for ever. be not carried away by divers and strange teachings for it is good that the heart be established by grace not by meats wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle. for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin are burned without the camp. wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered without the gate. let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp bearing his reproach. for we have not here an abiding city but we seek after [the city] which is to come. through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of lips which make confession to his name. but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased.  obey them that have the rule over you and submit [to them] for they watch in behalf of your souls as they that shall give account that they may do this with joy and not with grief for this [were] unprofitable for you. pray for us for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience desiring to live honorably in all things. and i exhort [you] the more exceedingly to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner. now the god of peace who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant [even] our lord jesus make you perfect in every good thing to do his will working in us that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. amen. but i exhort you brethren bear with the word of exhortation for i have written unto you in few words. know ye that our brother timothy hath been set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you. salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints. they of italy salute you. grace be with you all. amen.  james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are of the dispersion greeting. count it all joy my brethren when ye fall into manifold temptations knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience. and let patience have [its] perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking in nothing. but if any of you lacketh wisdom let him ask of god who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him. but let him ask in faith nothing doubting for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed. for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a doubleminded man unstable in all his ways. but let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate and the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. for the sun ariseth with the scorching wind and withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.  blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he hath been approved he shall receive the crown of life which [the lord] promised to them that love him. let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempteth no man but each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. then the lust when it hath conceived beareth sin and the sin when it is fullgrown bringeth forth death. be not deceived my beloved brethren. every good gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom can be no variation neither shadow that is cast by turning. of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. ye know [this] my beloved brethren. but let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god. wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness receive with meekness the implanted word which is able to save your souls.  but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deluding your own selves. for if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth away and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. but he that looketh into the perfect law the [law] of liberty and [so] continueth being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh this man shall be blessed in his doing. if any man thinketh himself to be religious while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart this mans religion is vain.  pure religion and undefiled before our god and father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction [and] to keep oneself unspotted from the world. my brethren hold not the faith of our lord jesus christ [the lord] of glory with respect of persons. for if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring in fine clothing and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing  and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing and say sit thou here in a good place and ye say to the poor man stand thou there or sit under my footstool do ye not make distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts hearken my beloved brethren did not god choose them that are poor as to the world [to be] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him but ye have dishonored the poor man. do not the rich oppress you and themselves drag you before the judgmentseats do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well but if ye have respect of persons ye commit sin being convicted by the law as transgressors.  for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet stumble in one [point] he is become guilty of all. for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill. now if thou dost not commit adultery but killest thou art become a transgressor of the law.  so speak ye and so do as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty. for judgment [is] without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy mercy glorieth against judgment. what doth it profit my brethren if a man say he hath faith but have not works can that faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food and one of you say unto them go in peace be ye warmed and filled and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it have not works is dead in itself. yea a man will say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith apart from [thy] works and i by my works will show thee [my] faith. thou believest that god is one thou doest well the demons also believe and shudder. but wilt thou know o vain man that faith apart from works is barren  was not abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up isaac his son upon the altar thou seest that faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect  and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and abraham believed god and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god. ye see that by works a man is justified and not only by faith. and in like manner was not also rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out another way for as the body apart from the spirit is dead even so faith apart from works is dead. be not many [of you] teachers my brethren knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment. for in many things we all stumble. if any stumbleth not in word the same is a perfect man able to bridle the whole body also. now if we put the horses bridles into their mouths that they may obey us we turn about their whole body also. behold the ships also though they are so great and are driven by rough winds are yet turned about by a very small rudder whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. so the tongue also is a little member and boasteth great things. behold how much wood is kindled by how small a fire  and the tongue is a fire the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the wheel of nature and is set on fire by hell. for every kind of beasts and birds of creeping things and things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed by mankind. but the tongue can no man tame [it is] a restless evil [it is] full of deadly poison. therewith bless we the lord and father and therewith curse we men who are made after the likeness of god out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. my brethren these things ought not so to be. doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter can a fig tree my brethren yield olives or a vine figs neither [can] salt water yield sweet. who is wise and understanding among you let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom. but if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart glory not and lie not against the truth. this wisdom is not [a wisdom] that cometh down from above but is earthly sensual devilish. for where jealousy and faction are there is confusion and every vile deed.  but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without variance without hypocrisy. and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace. whence [come] wars and whence [come] fightings among you [come they] not hence [even] of your pleasures that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and covet and cannot obtain ye fight and war ye have not because ye ask not. ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may spend [it] in your pleasures. ye adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of god. or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying but he giveth more grace. wherefore [the scripture] saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble. be subject therefore unto god but resist the devil and he will flee from you.  draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you. cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye doubleminded. be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness. humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall exalt you. speak not one against another brethren. he that speaketh against a brother or judgeth his brother speaketh against the law and judgeth the law but if thou judgest the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge. one [only] is the lawgiver and judge [even] he who is able to save and to destroy but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor come now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into this city and spend a year there and trade and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. what is your life for ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away. for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall both live and do this or that. but now ye glory in your vauntings all such glorying is evil. to him therefore that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin.  come now ye rich weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you. your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten. your gold and your silver are rusted and their rust shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh as fire. ye have laid up your treasure in the last days. behold the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth out and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth. ye have lived delicately on the earth and taken your pleasure ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter. ye have condemned ye have killed the righteous [one] he doth not resist you. be patient therefore brethren until the coming of the lord. behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth being patient over it until it receive the early and latter rain. be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord is at hand. murmur not brethren one against another that ye be not judged behold the judge standeth before the doors. take brethren for an example of suffering and of patience the prophets who spake in the name of the lord.  behold we call them blessed that endured ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord how that the lord is full of pity and merciful. but above all things my brethren swear not neither by the heaven nor by the earth nor by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay that ye fall not under judgment. is any among you suffering let him pray. is any cheerful let him sing praise. is any among you sick let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins it shall be forgiven him. confess therefore your sins one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed. the supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working. elijah was a man of like passions with us and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months. and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit. my brethren if any among you err from the truth and one convert him  let him know that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins. peter an apostle of jesus christ to the elect who are sojourners of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia according to the foreknowledge of god the father in sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace to you and peace be multiplied. blessed [be] the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead unto an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who by the power of god are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a little while if need be ye have been put to grief in manifold trials that the proof of your faith [being] more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of jesus christ  whom not having seen ye love on whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith [even] the salvation of [your] souls. concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that [should come] unto you searching what [time] or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did point unto when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glories that should follow them. to whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto you did they minister these things which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the holy spirit sent forth from heaven which things angel desire to look into. wherefore girding up the loins of your mind be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as children of obedience not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in [the time of] your ignorance  but like as he who called you is holy be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living because it is written ye shall be holy for i am holy. and if ye call on him as father who without respect of persons judgeth according to each mans work pass the time of your sojourning in fear knowing that ye were redeemed not with corruptible things with silver or gold from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers but with precious blood as of a lamb without spot [even the blood] of christ who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world but was manifested at the end of times for your sake who through him are believers in god that raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope might be in god. seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren love one another from the heart fervently having been begotten again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible through the word of god which liveth and abideth. for all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. the grass withereth and the flower falleth  but the word of the lord abideth for ever. and this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you. putting away therefore all wickedness and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes long for the spiritual milk which is without guile that ye may grow thereby unto salvation if ye have tasted that the lord is gracious unto whom coming a living stone rejected indeed of men but with god elect precious ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ. because it is contained in scripture behold i lay in zion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. for you therefore that believe is the preciousness but for such as disbelieve the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence for they stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed.  but ye are a elect race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for [gods] own possession that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light who in time past were no people but now are the people of god who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy. beloved i beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your behavior seemly among the gentiles that wherein they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they behold glorify god in the day of visitation. be subject to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether to the king as supreme or unto governors as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to them that do well. for so is the will of god that by welldoing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness but as bondservants of god. honor all men. love the brotherhood. fear god. honor the king.  servants [be] in subjection to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward. for this is acceptable if for conscience toward god a man endureth griefs suffering wrongfully. for what glory is it if when ye sin and are buffeted [for it] ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer [for it] ye shall take it patiently this is acceptable with god. for hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered threatened not but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree that we having died unto sins might live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed. for ye were going astray like sheep but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls. in like manner ye wives [be] in subjection to your won husbands that even if any obey not the word they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives  beholding your chaste behavior [coupled] with fear. whose [adorning] let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair and of wearing jewels of gold or of putting on apparel but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible [apparel] of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price. for after this manner aforetime the holy women also who hoped in god adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose children ye now are if ye do well and are not put in fear by any terror. ye husbands in like manner dwell with [your wives] according to knowledge giving honor unto the woman as unto the weaker vessel as being also jointheirs of the grace of life to the end that your prayers be not hindered. finally [be] ye all likeminded compassionate loving as brethren tenderhearted humbleminded not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling but contrariwise blessing for hereunto were ye called that ye should inherit a blessing. for he that would love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile  and let him turn away from evil and do good let him seek peace and pursue it. for the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears unto their supplication but the face of the lord is upon them that do evil. and who is he that will harm you if ye be zealous of that which is good but even if ye should suffer for righteousness sake blessed [are ye] and fear not their fear neither be troubled but sanctify in your hearts christ as lord [being] ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you yet with meekness and fear having a good conscience that wherein ye are spoken against they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in christ. for it is better if the will of god should so will that ye suffer for welldoing than for evildoing. because christ also suffered for sins once the righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison  that aforetime were disobedient when the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved through water which also after a true likeness doth now save you [even] baptism not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the interrogation of a good conscience toward god through the resurrection of jesus christ who is one the right hand of god having gone into heaven angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. forasmuch then as christ suffered in the flesh arm ye yourselves also with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god. for the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the gentiles and to have walked in lasciviousness lusts winebibbings revellings carousings and abominable idolatries wherein they think strange that ye run not with [them] into the same excess of riot speaking evil of [of] who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.  for unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit. but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore of sound mind and be sober unto prayer above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves for love covereth a multitude of sins using hospitality one to another without murmuring according as each hath received a gift ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speaketh [speaking] as it were oracles of god is any man ministereth [ministering] as of the strength which god supplieth that in all things god may be glorified through jesus christ whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. amen. beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you which cometh upon you to prove you as though a strange thing happened unto you but insomuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings rejoice that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.  if ye are reproached for the name of christ blessed [are ye] because the [spirit] of glory and the spirit of god resteth upon you. for let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evil doer or as a meddler in other mens matters but if [a man suffer] as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god in this name. for the time [is come] for judgment to begin at the house of god and if [it begin] first at us what [shall be] the end of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous is scarcely saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of god commit their souls in well doing unto a faithful creator. the elders among you i exhort who am a fellowelder and a witness of the sufferings of christ who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed  tend the flock of god which is among you exercising the oversight not of constraint but willingly according to [the will of] god nor yet for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.  and when the chief shepherd shall be manifested ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. likewise ye younger be subject unto the elder. yea all of you gird yourselves with humility to serve one another for god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble. humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your anxiety upon him because he careth for you. be sober be watchful your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom withstand stedfast in your faith knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. and the god of all grace who called you unto his eternal glory in christ after that ye have suffered a little while shall himself perfect establish strengthen you.  to him [be] the dominion for ever and ever. amen. by silvanus our faithful brother as i account [him] i have written unto you briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god. stand ye fast therein.  she that is in babylon elect together with [you] saluteth you and [so doth] mark my son. salute one another with a kiss of love. peace be unto you all that are in christ. simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our god and [the] saviour jesus christ grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust. yea and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence in your faith supply virtue and in [your] virtue knowledge  and in [your] knowledge self control and in [your] selfcontrol patience and in [your] patience godliness and in [your] godliness brotherly kindness and in [your] brotherly kindness love.  for if these things are yours and abound they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our lord jesus christ. for he that lacketh these things is blind seeing only what is near having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins. wherefore brethren give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never stumble for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ. wherefore i shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things though ye know them and are established in the truth which is with [you]. and i think it right as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly even as our lord jesus christ signified unto me. yea i will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance. for we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  for he received from god the father honor and glory when there was borne such a voice to him by the majestic glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice we [ourselves] heard borne out of heaven when we were with him in the holy mount. and we have the word of prophecy [made] more sure whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation. for no prophecy ever came by the will of man but men spake from god being moved by the holy spirit. but there arose false prophets also among the people as among you also there shall be false teachers who shall privily bring in destructive heresies denying even the master that bought them bringing upon themselves swift destruction. and many shall follow their lascivious doings by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of. and in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose sentence now from of old lingereth not and their destruction slumbereth not.  for if god spared not angels when they sinned but cast them down to hell and committed them to pits of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the ancient world but preserved noah with seven others a preacher of righteousness when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly and delivered righteous lot sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] lawless deeds the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement and despise dominion. daring selfwilled they tremble not to rail at dignities whereas angels though greater in might and power bring not a railing judgment against them before the lord.  but these as creatures without reason born mere animals to be taken and destroyed railing in matters whereof they are ignorant shall in their destroying surely be destroyed suffering wrong as the hire of wrongdoing [men] that count it pleasure to revel in the day time spots and blemishes revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin enticing unstedfast souls having a heart exercised in covetousness children of cursing forsaking the right way they went astray having followed the way of balaam the [son] of beor who loved the hire of wrongdoing but he was rebuked for his own transgression a dumb ass spake with mans voice and stayed the madness of the prophet. these are springs without water and mists driven by a storm for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. for uttering great swelling [words] of vanity they entice in the lusts of the flesh by lasciviousness those who are just escaping from them that live in error  promising them liberty while they themselves are bondservants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he also brought into bondage. for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the last state is become worse with them than the first. for it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them. it has happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog turning to his own vomit again and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire. this is now beloved the second epistle that i write unto you and in both of them i stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandments of the lord and saviour through your apostles knowing this first that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery walking after their own lusts  and saying where is the promise of his coming for from the day that the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. for this they willfully forget that there were heavens from of old and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water by the word of god by which means the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens that now are and the earth by the same word have been stored up for fire being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. but forget not this one thing beloved that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some count slackness but is longsuffering to youward not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in [all] holy living and godliness looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of god by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat but according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for these things give diligence that ye may be found in peace without spot and blameless in his sight. and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given to him wrote unto you as also in all [his] epistles speaking in them of these things wherein are some things hard to be understood which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest as [they do] also the other scriptures unto their own destruction. ye therefore beloved knowing [these things] beforehand beware lest being carried away with the error of the wicked ye fall from your own stedfastness.  but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ. to him [be] the glory both now and for ever. amen. that which was from the beginning that which we have heard that which we have seen with our eyes that which we beheld and our hands handled concerning the word of life and the life was manifested and we have seen and bear witness and declare unto you the life the eternal [life] which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also that ye also may have fellowship with us yea and our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things we write that our joy may be made full. and this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all. if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus his son cleanseth us from all sin. if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.  if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us. my little children these things write i unto you that ye may not sin. and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the whole world. and hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments. he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily hath the love of god been perfected. hereby we know that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked. beloved no new commandment write i unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye heard. again a new commandment write i unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shineth.  he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in the darkness even until now. he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. but he that hateth his brother is in the darkness and walketh in the darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. i write unto you [my] little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. i write unto you fathers because ye know him who is from the beginning. i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the evil one. i have written unto you little children because ye know the father. i have written unto you fathers because ye know him who is from the beginning. i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the evil one. love not the world neither the things that are in the world. if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him. for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vain glory of life is not of the father but is of the world.  and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever. little children it is the last hour and as ye heard that antichrist cometh even now have there arisen many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last hour. they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued with us but [they went out] that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us. and ye have an anointing from the holy one and ye know all the things. i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and because no lie is of the truth. who is the liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ this is the antichrist [even] he that denieth the father and the son. whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that confesseth the son hath the father also. as for you let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. if that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you ye also shall abide in the son and in the father.  and this is the promise which he promised us [even] the life eternal. these things have i written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray. and as for you the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any one teach you but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things and is true and is no lie and even as it taught you ye abide in him. and now [my] little children abide in him that if he shall be manifested we may have boldness and not be ashamed before him at his coming. if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him. behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called children of god and [such] we are. for this cause the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. beloved now are we children of god and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. we know that if he shall be manifested we shall be like him for we shall see him even as he is. and every one that hath this hope [set] on him purifieth himself even as he is pure.  every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness and sin is lawlessness. and ye know that he was manifested to take away sins and in him is no sin. whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither knoweth him. [my] little children let no man lead you astray he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that doeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning. to this end was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. whosoever is begotten of god doeth no sin because his seed abideth in him and he cannot sin because he is begotten of god. in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother. for this is the message which ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain was of the evil one and slew his brother. and wherefore slew he him because his works were evil and his brothers righteous. marvel not brethren if the world hateth you.  we know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren. he that loveth not abideth in death. whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. hereby know we love because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. but whoso hath the worlds goods and beholdeth his brother in need and shutteth up his compassion from him how doth the love of god abide in him [my] little children let us not love in word neither with the tongue but in deed and truth. hereby shall we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our heart before him because if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things. beloved if our heart condemn us not we have boldness toward god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another even as he gave us commandment.  and he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him and he in him. and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he gave us. beloved believe not every spirit but prove the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world. hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not jesus is not of god and this is the [spirit] of the antichrist whereof ye have heard that it cometh and now it is in the world already. ye are of god [my] little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. they are of the world therefore speak they [as] of the world and the world heareth them. we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he who is not of god heareth us not. by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is begotten of god and knoweth god. he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love.  herein was the love of god manifested in us that god hath sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son [to be] the propitiation for our sins. beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love one another. no man hath beheld god at any time if we love one another god abideth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit. and we have beheld and bear witness that the father hath sent the son [to be] the saviour of the world. whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god abideth in him and he in god. and we know and have believed the love which god hath in us. god is love and he that abideth in love abideth in god and god abideth in him. herein is love made perfect with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is even so are we in this world. there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath punishment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.  we love because he first loved us. if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen cannot love god whom he hath not seen. and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also. whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is begotten of god and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. hereby we know that we love the children of god when we love god and do his commandments. for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous. for whatsoever is begotten of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that hath overcome the world [even] our faith.  and who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god this is he that came by water and blood [even] jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and with the blood. and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is the truth.  for there are three who bear witness the spirit and the water and the blood and the three agree in one. if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for the witness of god is this that he hath borne witness concerning his son. he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in him he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he hath not believed in the witness that god hath borne concerning his son. and the witness is this that god gave unto us eternal life and this life is in his son. he that hath the son hath the life he that hath not the son of god hath not the life. these things have i written unto you that ye may know that ye have eternal life [even] unto you that believe on the name of the son of god. and this is the boldness which we have toward him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us  and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.  if any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death he shall ask and [god] will give him life for them that sin not unto death. there is a sin unto death not concerning this do i say that he should make request. all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death. we know that whosoever is begotten of god sinneth not but he that was begotten of god keepeth himself and the evil one toucheth him not. we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in the evil one. and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we know him that is true and we are in him that is true [even] in his son jesus christ. this is the true god and eternal life. [my] little children guard yourselves from idols. the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in truth and not i only but also all they that know the truth for the truths sake which abideth in us and it shall be with us for ever grace mercy peace shall be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love.  i rejoice greatly that i have found [certain] of thy children walking in truth even as we received commandment from the father. and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote to thee a new commandment but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another. and this is love that we should walk after his commandments. this is the commandment even as ye heard from the beginning that ye should walk in it. for many deceivers are gone forth into the world [even] they that confess not that jesus christ cometh in the flesh. this is the deceiver and the antichrist. look to yourselves that ye lose not the things which we have wrought but that ye receive a full reward. whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of christ hath not god he that abideth in the teaching the same hath both the father and the son. if any one cometh unto you and bringeth not this teaching receive him not into [your] house and give him no greeting for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.  having many things to write unto you i would not [write them] with paper and ink but i hope to come unto you and to speak face to face that your joy may be made full. the children of thine elect sister salute thee. the elder unto gaius the beloved whom i love in truth. beloved i pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth. for i rejoiced greatly when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth even as thou walkest in truth. greater joy have i none than this to hear of my children walking in the truth. beloved thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal who bare witness to thy love before the church whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of god because that for the sake of the name they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles. we therefore ought to welcome such that we may be fellow workers for the truth. i wrote somewhat unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not.  therefore if i come i will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth prating against us with wicked words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth [them] out of the church. beloved imitate not that which is evil but that which is good. he that doeth good is of god he that doeth evil hath not seen god. demetrius hath the witness of all [men] and of the truth itself yea we also bear witness and thou knowest that our witness is true. i had many things to write unto thee but i am unwilling to write [them] to thee with ink and pen but i hope shortly to see thee and we shall speak face to face. jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are called beloved in god the father and kept for jesus christ mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied. beloved while i was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation i was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.  for there are certain men crept in privily [even] they who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying our only master and lord jesus christ. now i desire to put you in remembrance though ye know all things once for all that the lord having saved a people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not. and angels that kept not their own principality but left their proper habitation he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh are set forth as an example suffering the punishment of eternal fire. yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh and set at nought dominion and rail at dignities. but michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing judgment but said the lord rebuke thee.  but these rail at whatsoever things they know not and what they understand naturally like the creatures without reason in these things are they destroyed. woe unto them for they went in the way of cain and ran riotously in the error of balaam for hire and perished in the gainsaying of korah. these are they who are hidden rocks in your lovefeasts when they feast with you shepherds that without fear feed themselves clouds without water carried along by winds autumn leaves without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots wild waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved forever. and to these also enoch the seventh from adam prophesied saying behold the lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment upon all and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.  these are murmurers complainers walking after their lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling [words] showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage. but ye beloved remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ that they said to you in the last time there shall be mockers walking after their own ungodly lusts. these are they who make separations sensual having not the spirit. but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy spirit keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life. and on some have mercy who are in doubt and some save snatching them out of the fire and on some have mercy with fear hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy to the only god our saviour through jesus christ our lord [be] glory majesty dominion and power before all time and now and for evermore. amen.  the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show unto his servants [even] the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant john who bare witness of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ [even] of all things that he saw. blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things that are written therein for the time is at hand. john to the seven churches that are in asia grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits that are before his throne and from jesus christ [who is] the faithful witness the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. unto him that loveth us and loosed us from our sins by his blood and he made us [to be] a kingdom [to be] priests unto his god and father to him [be] the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. amen. behold he cometh with the clouds and every eye shall see him and they that pierced him and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. even so amen.  i am the alpha and the omega saith the lord god who is and who was and who is to come the almighty. i john your brother and partaker with you in tribulation and kingdom and patience [which are] in jesus was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and the testimony of jesus. i was in the spirit on the lords day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying what thou seest write in a book and send [it] to the seven churches unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamum and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea. and i turned to see the voice that spake with me. and having turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle. and his head and his hair were white as white wool [white] as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto burnished brass as if it had been refined in a furnace and his voice as the voice of many waters.  and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. and when i saw him i fell at his feet as one dead. and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last and the living one and i was dead and behold i am alive for evermore and i have the keys of death and of hades. write therefore the things which thou sawest and the things which are and the things which shall come to pass hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks. the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks are seven churches. to the angel of the church in ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy toil and patience and that thou canst not bear evil men and didst try them that call themselves apostles and they are not and didst find them false  and thou hast patience and didst bear for my names sake and hast not grown weary. but i have [this] against thee that thou didst leave thy first love. remember therefore whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i come to thee and will move thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent. but this thou hast that thou hatest the works of the nicolaitans which i also hate. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. to him that overcometh to him will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of god. and to the angel of the church in smyrna write these things saith the first and the last who was dead and lived [again] i know thy tribulation and thy poverty but thou art rich and the blasphemy of them that say they are jews and they art not but are a synagogue of satan. fear not the things which thou art about to suffer behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days. be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee the crown of life.  he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. and to the angel of the church in pergamum write these things saith he that hath the sharp two edged sword i know where thou dwellest [even] where satans throne is and thou holdest fast my name and didst not deny my faith even in the days of antipas my witness my faithful one who was killed among you where satan dwelleth. but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. so hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the nicolaitans in like manner. repent therefore or else i come to thee quickly and i will make war against them with the sword of my mouth. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. to him that overcometh to him will i give of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone and upon the stone a new name written which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.  and to the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like unto burnished brass i know thy works and thy love and faith and ministry and patience and that thy last works are more than the first. but i have [this] against thee that thou sufferest the woman jezebel who calleth herself a prophetess and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols. and i gave her time that she should repent and she willeth not to repent of her fornication. behold i cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of her works. and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he that searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto each one of you according to your works. but to you i say to the rest that are in thyatira as many as have not this teaching who know not the deep things of satan as they are wont to say i cast upon you none other burden. nevertheless that which ye have hold fast till i come.  and he that overcometh and he that keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give authority over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers as i also have received of my father and i will give him the morning star. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. and to the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and thou art dead. be thou watchful and establish the things that remain which were ready to die for i have found no works of thine perfected before my god. remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear and keep [it] and repent. if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee. but thou hast a few names in sardis that did not defile their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy.  he that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments and i will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life and i will confess his name before my father and before his angels. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and none shall shut and that shutteth and none openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee a door opened which none can shut that thou hast a little power and didst keep my word and didst not deny my name. behold i give of the synagogue of satan of them that say they are jews and they are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee. because thou didst keep the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of trial that [hour] which is to come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth. i come quickly hold fast that which thou hast that no one take thy crown.  he that overcometh i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go out thence no more and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and mine own new name. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. and to the angel of the church in laodicea write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot. so because thou art lukewarm and neither hot nor cold i will spew thee out of my mouth. because thou sayest i am rich and have gotten riches and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire that thou mayest become rich and white garments that thou mayest clothe thyself and [that] the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes that thou mayest see. as many as i love i reprove and chasten be zealous therefore and repent.  behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me. he that overcometh i will give to him to sit down with me in my throne as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. after these things i saw and behold a door opened in heaven and the first voice that i heard [a voice] as of a trumpet speaking with me one saying come up hither and i will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter. straightway i was in the spirit and behold there was a throne set in heaven and one sitting upon the throne and he that sat [was] to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne like an emerald to look upon. and round about the throne [were] four and twenty thrones and upon the thrones [i saw] four and twenty elders sitting arrayed in white garments and on their heads crowns of gold.  and out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. and [there was] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne as it were a sea of glass like a crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. and the first creature [was] like a lion and the second creature like a calf and the third creature had a face as of a man and the fourth creature [was] like a flying eagle. and the four living creatures having each one of them six wings are full of eyes round about and within and they have no rest day and night saying holy holy holy [is] the lord god the almighty who was and who is and who is to come. and when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne to him that liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever and shall cast their crowns before the throne saying  worthy art thou our lord and our god to receive the glory and the honor and the power for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they were and were created. and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back close sealed with seven seals. and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof  and no one in the heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look thereon. and i wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion that is of the tribe of judah the root of david hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. and i saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a lamb standing as though it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth. and he came and he taketh [it] out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.  and when he had taken the book the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having each one a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints. and they sing a new song saying worthy art thou to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and didst purchase unto god with thy blood [men] of every tribe and tongue and people and nation  and madest them [to be] unto our god a kingdom and priests and they reign upon earth. and i saw and i heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a great voice worthy is the lamb that hath been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing. and every created thing which is in the heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things are in them heard i saying unto him that sitteth on the throne and unto the lamb [be] the blessing and the honor and the glory and the dominion for ever and ever.  and the four living creatures said amen. and the elders fell down and worshipped. and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder come. and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat thereon had a bow and there was given unto him a crown and he came forth conquering and to conquer. and when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature saying come.  and another [horse] came forth a red horse and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth and that they should slay one another and there was given unto him a great sword. and when he opened the third seal i heard the third living creature saying come. and i saw and behold a black horse and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. and i heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling and the oil and the wine hurt thou not. and when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying come.  and i saw and behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him his name was death and hades followed with him. and there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with death and by the wild beasts of the earth. and when he opened the fifth seal i saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a great voice saying how long o master the holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and there was given them to each one a white robe and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little time until their fellowservants also and their brethren who should be killed even as they were should have fulfilled [their course]. and i saw when he opened the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the whole moon became as blood and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.  and the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. and the kings of the earth and the princes and the chief captains and the rich and the strong and every bondman and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains and they say to the mountains and to the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath is come and who is able to stand after his i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that no wind should blow on the earth or on the sea or upon any tree. and i saw another angel ascend from the sunrising having the seal of the living god and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we shall have sealed the servants of our god on their foreheads. and i heard the number of them that were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand sealed out of every tribe of the children of israel  of the tribe of judah [were] sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben twelve thousand of the tribe of gad twelve thousand of the tribe of asher twelve thousand of the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand of the tribe of levi twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar twelve thousand of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand. after these things i saw and behold a great multitude which no man could number out of every nation and of [all] tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the lamb arrayed in white robes and palms in their hands and they cry with a great voice saying salvation unto our god who sitteth on the throne and unto the lamb. and all the angels were standing round about the throne and [about] the elders and the four living creatures and they fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god  saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might [be] unto our god for ever and ever. amen. and one of the elders answered saying unto me these that are arrayed in white robes who are they and whence came they and i say unto him my lord thou knowest. and he said to me these are they that come of the great tribulation and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb. therefore are they before the throne of god and they serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun strike upon them nor any heat for the lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life and god shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. and when he opened the seventh seal there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. and i saw the seven angels that stand before god and there were given unto them seven trumpets.  and another angel came and stood over the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints went up before god out of the angels hand. and the angel taketh the censer and he filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it upon the earth and there followed thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake. and the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. and the first sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the earth was burnt up and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up. and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea [even] they that had life and the third part of the ships was destroyed.  and the third angel sounded and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a torch and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of the waters and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter. and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars that the third part of them should be darkened and the day should not shine for the third part of it and the night in like manner. and i saw and i heard an eagle flying in mid heaven saying with a great voice woe woe woe for them that dwell on the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are yet to sound. and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss. and he opened the pit of the abyss and there went up a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.  and out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth and power was given them as the scorpions of the earth have power. and it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only such men as have not the seal of god on their foreheads. and it was given them that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man. and in those days men shall seek death and shall in no wise find it and they shall desire to die and death fleeth from them. and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold and their faces were as mens faces. and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as [teeth] of lions. and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses rushing to war. and they have tails like unto scorpions and stings and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.  they have over them as king the angel of the abyss his name in hebrew is abaddon and in the greek [tongue] he hath the name apollyon. the first woe is past behold there come yet two woes hereafter. and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before god one saying to the sixth angel that had one trumpet loose the four angels that are bound at the great river euphrates. and the four angels were loosed that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they should kill the third part of men. and the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand i heard the number of them. and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates [as] of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone and the heads of lions and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone. by these three plagues was the third part of men killed by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.  for the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails are like unto serpents and have heads and with them they hurt. and the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship demons and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood which can neither see nor hear nor walk and they repented not of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts. and i saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven arrayed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left upon the earth and he cried with a great voice as a lion roareth and when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices. and when the seven thunders uttered [their voices] i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not.  and the angel that i saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created the heaven and the things that are therein and the earth and the things that are therein and the sea and the things that are therein that there shall be delay no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound then is finished they mystery of god according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets. and the voice which i heard from heaven [i heard it] again speaking with me and saying go take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. and i went unto the angel saying unto him that he should give me the little book. and he saith unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and when i had eaten it my belly was made bitter.  and they say unto me thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and one said rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein. and the court which is without the temple leave without and measure it not for it hath been given unto the nations and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. and i will give unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth. these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the lord of the earth. and if any man desireth to hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man shall desire to hurt them in this manner must he be killed. these have the power to shut the heaven that it rain not during the days of their prophecy and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they shall desire.  and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them and overcome them and kill them. and their dead bodies [lie] in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also their lord was crucified. and from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do [men] look upon their dead bodies three days and a half and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. and they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry and they shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. and after the three days and a half the breath of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither. and they went up into heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them.  and in that hour there was a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons and the rest were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven. the second woe is past behold the third woe cometh quickly. and the seventh angel sounded and there followed great voices in heaven and they said the kingdom of the world is become [the kingdom] of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. and the four and twenty elders who sit before god on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped god saying we give thee thanks o lord god the almighty who art and who wast because thou hast taken thy great power and didst reign. and the nations were wroth and thy wrath came and the time of the dead to be judged and [the time] to give their reward to thy servants the prophets and to the saints and to them that fear thy name the small and the great and to destroy them that destroy the earth.  and there was opened the temple of god that is in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant and there followed lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail. and a great sign was seen in heaven a woman arrayed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she was the child and she crieth out travailing in birth and in pain to be delivered. and there was seen another sign in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and upon his heads seven diadems. and his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered that when she is delivered he may devour her child. and she was delivered of a son a man child who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and unto his throne. and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.  and there was war in heaven michael and his angels [going forth] to war with the dragon and the dragon warred and his angels and they prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven. and the great dragon was cast down the old serpent he that is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole world he was cast down to the earth and his angels were cast down with him. and i heard a great voice in heaven saying now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down who accuseth them before our god day and night. and they overcame him because of the blood of the lamb and because of the word of their testimony and they loved not their life even unto death. therefore rejoice o heavens and ye that dwell in them. woe for the earth and for the sea because the devil is gone down unto you having great wrath knowing that he hath but a short time. and when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man [child].  and there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent. and the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream. and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth. and the dragon waxed wroth with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed that keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus and he stood upon the sand of the sea. and i saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on his horns ten diadems and upon his heads names of blasphemy. and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.  and [i saw] one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death and his deathstroke was healed and the whole earth wondered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast and who is able to war with him and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months. and he opened his mouth for blasphemies against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle [even] them that dwell in the heaven. and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.  and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him [every one] whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that hath been slain. if any man hath an ear let him hear.  if any man [is] for captivity into captivity he goeth if any man shall kill with the sword with the sword must he be killed. here is the patience and the faith of the saints. and i saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like unto lamb and he spake as a dragon. and he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. and he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deathstroke was healed. and he doeth great signs that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. and it was given [unto him] to give breath to it [even] to the image to the breast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  and he causeth all the small and the great and the rich and the poor and the free and the bond that there be given them a mark on their right hand or upon their forehead and that no man should be able to buy or to sell save he that hath the mark [even] the name of the beast or the number of his name. here is wisdom. he that hath understanding let him count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred and sixty and six. and i saw and behold the lamb standing on the mount zion and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand having his name and the name of his father written on their foreheads. and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and the voice which i heard [was] as [the voice] of harpers harping with their harps and they sing as it were a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand [even] they that had been purchased out of the earth.  these are they that were not defiled with women for they are virgins. these [are] they that follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth. these were purchased from among men [to be] the firstfruits unto god and unto the lamb. and in their mouth was found no lie they are without blemish. and i saw another angel flying in mid heaven having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people and he saith with a great voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. and another a second angel followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. and another angel a third followed them saying with a great voice if any man worshippeth the beast and his image and receiveth a mark on his forehead or upon his hand  he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day and night they that worship the beast and his image and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. here is the patience of the saints they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus. and i heard the voice from heaven saying write blessed are the dead who die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labors for their works follow with them. and i saw and behold a white cloud and on the cloud [i saw] one sitting like unto a son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand sharp sickle. and another angel came out from the temple crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud send forth thy sickle and reap for the hour to reap is come for the harvest of the earth is ripe. and he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth and the earth was reaped.  another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle. and another angel came out from the altar he that hath power over fire and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle saying send forth thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe. and the angel cast his sickle into the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and cast it into the winepress the great [winepress] of the wrath of god. and the winepress are trodden without the city and there came out blood from the winepress even unto the bridles of the horses as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs. and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having seven plagues [which are] the last for in them is finished the wrath of god. and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that come off victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing by the sea of glass having harps of god.  and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works o lord god the almighty righteous and true are thy ways thou king of the ages. who shall not fear o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all the nations shall come and worship before thee for thy righteous acts have been made manifest. and after these things i saw and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues arrayed with [precious] stone pure [and] bright and girt about their breasts with golden girdles. and one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever. and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and none was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished. and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go ye and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of god into the earth.  and the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image. and the second poured out his bowl into the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living soul died [even] the things that were in the sea. and the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters and it became blood. and i heard the angel of the waters saying righteous art thou who art and who wast thou holy one because thou didst thus judge for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets and blood hast thou given them to drink they are worthy. and i heard the altar saying yea o lord god the almighty true and righteous are thy judgments. and the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. and men were scorched men with great heat and they blasphemed the name of god who hath the power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory.  and the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast and his kingdom was darkened and they gnawed their tongues for pain and they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and they repented not of their works. and the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river the [river] euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way might by made ready for the kings that [come] from the sunrising. and i saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits as it were frogs for they are spirits of demons working signs which go forth unto the kings of the whole world to gather them together unto the war of the great day of god the almighty. behold i come as a thief. blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walked naked and they see his shame. and they gathered them together into the place which is called in hebrew harmagedon. and the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air and there came forth a great voice out of the temple from the throne saying it is done  and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and there was a great earthquake such as was not since there were men upon the earth so great an earthquake so mighty. and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and babylon the great was remembered in the sight of god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. and every island fled away and the mountains were not found. and great hail [every stone] about the weight of a talent cometh down out of heaven upon men and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof is exceeding great. and there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls and spake with me saying come hither i will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication. and he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and i saw a woman sitting upon a scarletcolored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns.  and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations even the unclean things of her fornication and upon her forehead a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth. and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus. and when i saw her i wondered with a great wonder. and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou wonder i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. the beast that thou sawest was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into perdition. and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder [they] whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast how that he was and is not and shall come. here is the mind that hath wisdom. the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth  and they are seven kings the five are fallen the one is the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a little while. and the beast that was and is not is himself also an eighth and is of the seven and he goeth into perdition. and the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. these have one mind and they give their power and authority unto the beast. these shall war against the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they [also shall overcome] that are with him called and chosen and faithful. and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the harlot sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. and the ten horns which thou sawest and the beast these shall hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her utterly with fire. for god did put in their hearts to do his mind and to come to one mind and to give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god should be accomplished.  and the woman whom thou sawest is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth. after these things i saw another angel coming down out of heaven having great authority and the earth was lightened with his glory. and he cried with a mighty voice saying fallen fallen is babylon the great and is become a habitation of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird. for by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness. and i heard another voice from heaven saying come forth my people out of her that ye have no fellowship with her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached even unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities. render unto her even as she rendered and double [unto her] the double according to her works in the cup which she mingled mingle unto her double.  how much soever she glorified herself and waxed wanton so much give her of torment and mourning for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall in no wise see mourning. therefore in one day shall her plagues come death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judged her. and the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her shall weep and wail over her when they look upon the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying woe woe the great city babylon the strong city for in one hour is thy judgment come. and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more merchandise of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel made of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble  and cinnamon and spice and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep and [merchandise] of horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men. and the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee and [men] shall find them no more at all. the merchants of these things who were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and mourning saying woe woe the great city she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. and every shipmaster and every one that saileth any wither and mariners and as many as gain their living by sea stood afar off and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning saying what [city] is like the great city and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and mourning saying woe woe the great city wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate.  rejoice over her thou heaven and ye saints and ye apostles and ye prophets for god hath judged your judgment on her. and a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with a mighty fall shall babylon the great city be cast down and shall be found no more at all. and the voice of harpers and minstrels and fluteplayers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft shall be found any more at all in thee and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the princes of the earth for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived. and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that have been slain upon the earth. after these things i heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and power belong to our god  for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great harlot her that corrupted the earth with her fornication and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. and a second time they say hallelujah. and her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. and the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped god that sitteth on the throne saying amen hallelujah. and a voice came forth from the throne saying give praise to our god all ye his servants ye that fear him the small and the great. and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunders saying hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigneth. let us rejoice and be exceeding glad and let us give the glory unto him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready. and it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen bright [and] pure for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.  and he saith unto me write blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the lamb. and he saith unto me these are true words of god. and i fell down before his feet to worship him. and he saith unto me see thou do it not i am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy. and i saw the heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat thereon called faithful and true and in righteous he doth judge and make war. and his eyes [are] a flame of fire and upon his head [are] many diadems and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself. and he [is] arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood and his name is called the word of god. and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white [and] pure. and out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god the almighty.  and he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written kings of kings and lord of lords. and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven come [and] be gathered together unto the great supper of god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon and the flesh of all men both free and bond and small and great. and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse and against his army. and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse [even the sword] which came forth out of his mouth and all the birds were filled with their flesh.  and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. and he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss and shut [it] and sealed [it] over him that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be finished after this he must be loosed for a little time. and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and [i saw] the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of jesus and for the word of god and such as worshipped not the beast neither his image and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years. the rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. this is the first resurrection. blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection over these the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years. and when the thousand years are finished satan shall be loosed out of his prison  and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to the war the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  and they went up over the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down out of heaven and devoured them. and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where are also the beast and the false prophet and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. and i saw a great white throne and him that sat upon it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them. and i saw the dead the great and the small standing before the throne and books were opened and another book was opened which is [the book] of life and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books according to their works. and the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them and they were judged every man according to their works.  and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. this is the second death [even] the lake of fire. and if any was not found written in the book of life he was cast into the lake of fire. and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away and the sea is no more.  and i saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down out of heaven of god made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. and i heard a great voice out of the throne saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his peoples and god himself shall be with them [and be] their god and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more the first things are passed away. and he that sitteth on the throne said behold i make all things new. and he saith write for these words are faithful and true. and he said unto me they are come to pass. i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end. i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.  he that overcometh shall inherit these things and i will be his god and he shall be my son. but for the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars their part [shall be] in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death.  and there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls who were laden with the seven last plagues and he spake with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the wife of the lamb. and he carried me away in the spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god having the glory of god her light was like unto a stone most precious as it were a jasper stone clear as crystal having a wall great and high having twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates.  and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb. and he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof. and the city lieth foursquare and the length thereof is as great as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal. and he measured the wall thereof a hundred and forty and four cubits [according to] the measure of a man that is of an angel. and the building of the wall thereof was jasper and the city was pure gold like unto pure glass. the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth the twelfth amethyst.  and the twelve gates were twelve pearls each one of the several gates was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass. and i saw no temple therein for the lord god the almighty and the lamb are the temple thereof. and the city hath no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine upon it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamp thereof [is] the lamb. and the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. and the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean or he that maketh an abomination and a lie but only they that are written in the lambs book of life. and he showed me a river of water of life bright as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street thereof. and on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life bearing twelve [manner of] fruits yielding its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  and there shall be no curse any more and the throne of god and of the lamb shall be therein and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name [shall be] on their foreheads. and there shall be night no more and they need no light of lamp neither light of sun for the lord god shall give them light and they shall reign for ever and ever. and he said unto me these words are faithful and true and the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass. and behold i come quickly. blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. and i john am he that heard and saw these things. and when i heard and saw i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. and he saith unto me see thou do it not i am a fellowservant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets and with them that keep the words of this book worship god. and he saith unto me seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand.  he that is unrighteous let him do unrighteousness still and he that is filthy let him be made filthy still and he that is righteous let him do righteousness still and he that is holy let him be made holy still. behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to render to each man according as his work is. i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end. blessed are they that wash their robes that they may have the right [to come] to the tree of life and my enter in by the gates into the city. without are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and every one that loveth and maketh a lie. i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. i am the root and the offspring of david the bright the morning star. and the spirit and the bride say come. and he that heareth let him say come. and he that is athirst let him come he that will let him take the water of life freely.  i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto them god shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city which are written in this book. he who testifieth these things saith yea i come quickly. amen come lord jesus. the grace of the lord jesus be with the saints. amen.
